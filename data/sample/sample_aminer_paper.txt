It is especially serious in North China Plain. In this paper, different soil water content control levels at winter wheat growth stages are performed on Gucheng Ecological-Meteorological Integrated Observation Experiment Station of CAMS, China. Some canopy parameters, including growth conditions, dry weight, physiological parameters and hyperspectral reflectance, are measured from erecting stage to milk stage for winter wheat in 2009. The relationship between canopy parameters and soil relative moisture, canopy water content and water indices of winter wheat are established. The results show that some parameters, such as SPAD and dry weight of leaves, decrease with the increasing of soil relative moisture, while other parameters, including dry weight of caudexes, above ground dry weight, height, photosynthesis rate, intercellular CO 2 concentration, stomatal conductance and transpiration rate, increase corresponding to the soil relative moisture. Obvious linear relationship between stomatal conductance and transpiration rate is established with 45 samples, which R2 reaches to 0.6152. Finally, the fitting equations between canopy water content and water indices are regressed with b5, b6 and b7 of MODIS bands. The equations are best with b7 and worst with b5. So the fitting equations with b7 can be used to inverse the canopy water content of winter wheat using MODIS or other remote sensing images with similar bands range to MODIS in Hebei Province. \u00a9 2011 IEEE.", "references": ["53e999c3b7602d970220b9b7", "53e9b1d6b7602d9703c68fd3", "53e9aa48b7602d97033b48b9"]}

Blocking the synthesis of protective proteins through a transcriptional inhibitor such as actinomycin D (Act D) sensitizes many cell types to TNF-\u03b1 toxicity. Teduglutide, h[Gly(2)]GLP-2, is a protease-resistant synthetic analog of glucagon-like peptide-2 (GLP-2) which is an intestinotrophic peptide. In this study, we evaluated this potential of GLP-2 on apoptosis, cell proliferation, and oxidant-antioxidant system on a mouse model of intestinal injury induced by TNF-\u03b1/Act D. The intestinal injury was induced by intraperitoneal administration of 15 \u03bcg/kg TNF-\u03b1 and 800 \u03bcg/kg Act D per mouse. Animals were injected subcutaneously 200 \u03bcg/kg h[Gly(2)]GLP-2 every 12 h for 10 consecutive days prior to the administration of TNF-\u03b1 and Act D. The model of intestinal injury induced by TNF-\u03b1/Act D, which is the new animal model for the intestinal disorders, was characterized by the degeneration of intestinal mucosa, an increase in apoptotic index, expression of active caspase-3, lipid peroxidation and glutathione (GSH) levels, glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities; a decrease in cell proliferation and catalase (CAT) activity. h[Gly(2)]GLP-2 pretreatment prevented the TNF-\u03b1/Act D-induced oxidative injury by a significant reduction in the intestinal injury, apoptotic index, expression of active caspase-3, lipid peroxidation and GSH levels, GPx and SOD activities; a markedly increase in cell proliferation, and CAT activity. These results demonstrate that GLP-2 has a protective, antiapoptotic, proliferative, and antioxidant effects against to TNF-\u03b1/Act D-induced intestinal injury. It is suggested that GLP-2 may potentially be useful as a therapeutic agent in TNF-\u03b1-mediated intestinal disorders.", "references": ["53e99b4ab7602d97023ea8fd", "53e997f8b7602d9701ffea5d", "53e9aff4b7602d9703a4bbcd", "53e99a43b7602d97022a19e9", "53e9a789b7602d97030c3df9", "53e9b54fb7602d9704085d67", "56d8242adabfae2eeed0f300", "53e99e62b7602d9702729740", "55a3d232612ca6486879b4fe", "53e9bd81b7602d9704a23f4c", "53e9b775b7602d970431a37c", "53e9bbb5b7602d97048004a5", "53e9a3b9b7602d9702cc8299", "53e9a757b7602d970309091e", "53e9b850b7602d97044127d0", "56d9292adabfae2eeecdce79", "53e9a37ab7602d9702c8622e", "55a3ba48c91b587b0960936f", "53e9ba05b7602d97046046f6", "53e99d73b7602d970262b422", "53e9bc4eb7602d97048c2d96", "53e9ba3fb7602d970464d39d", "55a34f99612ca6486868b720", "53e9a4cfb7602d9702df183b", "56d9106adabfae2eee37df11", "53e9b587b7602d97040c8808", "53e9baa0b7602d97046cba95", "53e999a5b7602d97021e85ac", "55a3a273612ca6486873e655", "53e9b0f5b7602d9703b719f2", "53e9b4e9b7602d9704014652", "53e997f8b7602d9701ffea75", "53e9a3e7b7602d9702cfc56e", "53e9b070b7602d9703ada007", "53e9b63bb7602d970419830d", "53e99cf5b7602d97025abef2", "53e99f3ab7602d9702808e80", "55a5e55965cead59c82eb739", "55a485bb2401032899725b80", "53e99a48b7602d97022a7355", "53e9b621b7602d970417b97a", "53e99984b7602d97021c6e4f", "53e9ae0bb7602d9703814cac", "56d82095dabfae2eeeb98d7b", "53e9a584b7602d9702eac058", "53e9a8ccb7602d9703219eb3", "53e99eeeb7602d97027bad18", "53e99b21b7602d97023b820c", "53e9ae6fb7602d970388d1f0", "56d8fe08dabfae2eeec50589", "53e9b1a3b7602d9703c2dcbf"]}

Liver index( liver/body weight ratio), serum activities of liver-associated enzymes, blood lipids, FFA, leptin, fasting blood glucose, fast plasma insulin, HOMA insulin resistance index ( HOMA -IR ), IL-6 , TNF, liver triglycerides, liver cholesterol , liver tissue MDA,SOD and the liver histology of rats of all groups were assayed. Results: The body weight, liver index, serum activities of alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) , aspartate aminotransferase (AST), total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG) and liver triglycerides, liver cholesterol , liver tissue MDA, HOMA-IR, FFA, leptin, IL-6, TNF in the fatty liver group increased significantly, while liver tissue SOD concentration decreased significantly. Fast blood glucose, fast plasma insulin showed an increasing tendency, but there was no significant difference among the two groups. The liver histology in the the fatty liver group showed moderate to severe steatosis, mainly as macro vesicle steatosis, lobular inflammatory, cell infiltration and necrosis. Conclusion: It is suggested that there is leptin resistence and insulin resistence in fatty liver rats induced by high fat feeding."}

The role of 'classic' hormones, such as ecdysteroids and juvenoids, to control reproduction is well documented in a large variety of insect species. In adult gonads, ecdysteroids appear to induce a cascade of transcription factors, many of which also occur during the larval molting response. Recent molecular and functional data have created opportunities to study an additional level of regulation, that of neuropeptides, growth factors and their respective receptors. As a result, many homologs of factors playing a role in vertebrate reproductive physiology have been discovered in insects. This review highlights several neuropeptides controlling the biosynthesis and release of the 'classic' insect hormones, as well as various peptides and biogenic amines that regulate behavioural aspects of the reproduction process. In addition, hormone metabolizing enzymes and second messenger pathways are discussed with respect to their role in reproductive tissues. Finally, we speculate on future prospects for insect neuroendocrinological research as a consequence of the recent 'Genomics Revolution'."}

We address the timing yield problem for sequential circuits and propose a statistical approach to handle it. We consider the spatial and path reconvergence correlations between path delays, set-up time and hold time constraints, and clock skew due to process variations. We propose a method to get the timing yield based on the delay distributions of register-to-register paths in the circuit On average, the timing yield results obtained by our approach have average errors of less than 1.0% in comparison with Monte Carlo simulation. Experimental results show that shortest path variations and clock skew due to process variations have considerable impact on circuit timing, which could bias the timing yield results. In addition, the correlation between longest and shortest path delays is not significant.", "references": ["53e99c99b7602d970254e9bf", "53e9b002b7602d9703a5c932", "53e9a8a9b7602d97031f6bb9", "53e9b321b7602d9703deb3c2", "53e9a58cb7602d9702eb5811", "53e9a6a6b7602d9702fdc57e", "56d87b94dabfae2eee3f6a9b", "53e9aad9b7602d970345afea", "53e99ebdb7602d97027840a3", "53e99d1ab7602d97025cb670", "53e9a9ccb7602d970332e5f7", "53e9ab65b7602d97035012b3", "53e9ab65b7602d97035012b2", "53e99af2b7602d970237f6ee", "53e9bb9ab7602d97047dfb7f", "53e9b443b7602d9703f3e52b"]}

In this study we investigated bird feeding behavior during 80 hours of focal observations, in eight fruiting plants of Struthanthus concinnus located in a forest fragment border in Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais state. Eleven species of Passeriformes from four families (Tyrannidae (6), Emberizidae (3), Pipridae (1) and Vireonidae (1)) were observed consuming fruits of S. concinnus in 173 feeding bouts. Five species, Hylophylus amaurocephalus, Ilicura militaris, Phaeomyias murina, Tersina viridis and Piranga flava, were the most frequent consumers. The bird foraging tactics observed were classified in two basic types: \"glean\", the most commonly utilized, and \"sally\". All the species swallow fruits whole and no bird was considered seed predator. Birds, except for T. viridis, generally stayed short periods of time (< 3 min) feeding on the plants, being considered as potential dispersers of seeds to farther areas. The regurgitation of intact seeds, after peeling and eating the exocarp, was ob served in seven species (n = 27). Five species (Pipridae and Tyrannidae) were observed wiping their bills leaving seeds adhered to perches. This behavior is considered an important seed deposition mode for this mistletoe.

This region contains a pyrimidine-rich sequence, which is similar to the hypoxia-responsive mRNA-stabilizing element of tyrosine hydroxylase. This study aimed to determine whether hypoxia affects insulin mRNA levels.Rat islets were incubated at normoxic or hypoxic conditions and with or without hydrogen peroxide and a nitric oxide donor. Insulin mRNA was determined by Northern hybridization. Islet homogenates were used for electrophoretic mobility shift assay with an RNA-oligonucleotide, corresponding to the pyrimidine-rich sequence of the 3'-UTR of rat insulin I mRNA. The expression of reporter gene mRNA, in islets transfected with reporter gene constructs containing the wild-type or mutated insulin mRNA pyrimidine-rich sequences, was measured by semiquantitive RT-PCR.Insulin mRNA was increased in response to hypoxia. This was paralleled by increased binding of the polypyrimidine tract-binding protein (PTB) to the pyrimidine-rich sequence of the 3'-UTR of insulin mRNA, which was counteracted by hydrogen peroxide. The reporter gene mRNA level containing the wild-type binding site was not increased in response to hypoxia, but mutation of the site resulted in a destabilization of the mRNA.The complete understanding of different diabetic conditions requires the elucidation of mechanisms that control insulin gene expression. Our data show that hypoxia may increase insulin mRNA levels by promoting the binding of PTB to the insulin mRNA 3'-UTR.

This can lead to defects such as centerline segregation. To understand the flow properties of the interdendritic liquid, samples of Al\u201312 wt.% Cu were solidified directionally in a Bridgman furnace and quenched to capture the growing columnar dendritic structures. The quenched samples were scanned using a laboratory X-ray microtomography (XMT) unit to obtain the 3D structure with a voxel resolution of 7.2 \u03bcm. Image analysis was used to separate the Al dendrite from the interdendritic Al\u2013Al 2 Cu eutectic. Flow between the dendrites was simulated by solving the Stokes equation to calculate the permeability tensor as a function of the fraction solid. The results were compared to prior experimental measurements and calculations using synchrotron tomography observations of equiaxed structures. Elasto\u2013plastic finite element (FE) simulations were performed on the dendritic structures to determine flow stress behavior as a function of fraction solid. It was found that the standard approximations for the reduction in flow stress in the semi-solid have a variation in excess of 100% from that calculated using the true structure. Therefore, it is critical to simulate the actual dendrite for effective flow stress determination.
