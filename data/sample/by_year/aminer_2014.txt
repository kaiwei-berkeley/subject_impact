Over the past few years, dozens of small, early-phase clinical trials have tested the value of adult stem cells in treating debilitating or life-threatening heart disease. Results have been mixed, but most peer-reviewed academic reports have hinted that patients may be helped. This has, understandably, encouraged clinicians to move potential therapies into large and expensive phase III trials to establish whether the treatments can fulfil their promise. Now comes a shocking reality check, revealed this week in the British Medical Journal (BMJ). As we report on page 15, a London-based team has scrutinized reports of all the randomized trials of bone-marrow stem-cell treatments for heart disease they could find. The authors searched for discrepancies that might undermine the results and found plenty \u2014 errors such as numbers not adding up, or individual patients reported variously as male and female, dead and alive. In fact, the researchers found a linear relationship between the number of discrepancies and the claimed effect size. The small number of trials that they identified as unflawed showed an effect size of zero. In other words, the scientists declare this stem-cell emperor to have no clothes. The multitude of discrepancies may not necessarily invalidate the conclusions of an individual trial \u2014 the authors point out that all too often the clinical data are not available, leaving them unable to check whether the discrepancies are real errors or just the result of sloppy reporting. But, at the very least, the BMJ report should raise the question of whether the data are really strong enough to support the big step of moving to a phase III trial, particularly given that in the case of adult stem cells the results of animal studies have been ambiguous. Initially, researchers suggested that these cells became specialized to the target organ and replaced damaged tissue, but this idea has since been rejected. Many clinicians now think that the cells instead act to heal the surrounding tissue, releasing molecules that cause inflammation and the growth of oxygen-bearing small blood vessels, processes important to repair. The findings of the BMJ study raise another worrying question: why did the clinical journals concerned fail to notice the discrepancies, given that many of the errors seem, in hindsight at least, to be startlingly visible? If a table claims to describe nclinical events, for example, but in its columns refers to n\u2009+\u20092 events, is that really so hard to catch? This, in turn, raises more queries about the process. Who should take responsibility for fact-checking a paper for internal consistency? Is it the notoriously busy clinical experts who act as referees? Or the editors, many of whom also have a full schedule of clinical duties? Few of the journals that published the papers scrutinized in this case have professional editors or significant numbers of in-house editing staff. Pressure to review and publish quickly is high. The two sides of the equation don\u2019t balance, and the problems identified in the study suggest something of a crisis. To address this, the publishers of clinical journals must do more to ensure that someone takes responsibility for the fact-checking. That could involve asking authors to guarantee that they have checked figures, tables, text and abstracts for internal consistency. Publishers could require authors to make available suitably anonymized data on each patient as metadata to the study, so that readers can trace the source of any discrepancy that might creep through. Or the publishers could reach into their pockets and provide more in-house resources to perform the necessary checking. What is not acceptable is for the situation to continue as it is, with responsibilities undefined and inexact publishing distorting clinical messages. The problem seems to run deeper than the heart and stem-cell studies checked in this case. For years, analyses have highlighted a bias towards publishing clinical trials that show a positive outcome. (A similar trend has also been found with scientific results.) Translational medicine is one of the buzz-phrases of the twenty-first century. In a way, it should be a surprise that it has taken so long for the idea to catch on. What use is medicine that is stuck in the scientific laboratory? But as the curious case of adult stem cells demonstrates, the right checks and balances are not brakes on progress, but an essential foundation for that progress. Fools rush in. So do those who have not done their homework.", "references": ["53e99a1fb7602d9702273a32"]}

For a few moments he confused the steady wheezing of the ventilator, pumped by one of Lord C_'s own servants, with the rhythmic beat of the steam hammers on the dig in France. The medics were muttering. As he drifted in and out of consciousness he heard that idiotic phrase, 'The Curse of the Presidents'. Superstitious idiots. The hospital room faded as his struggling brain took him back to the moment when they broke through. It was the first time he'd been to Europe. For many years after the Collapse, it had been pretty much impossible to visit from the USA. Even now, the stone-age European peasants \u2014 all that remained of their great civilization \u2014 regarded foreigners with suspicion. But when Lord C_ arranged the dig, the locals in Aube realized that good dollars in the hand were far better than worrying about these strange people with their monstrous, hissing machines. As Howard watched the excavation engine creep slowly into place, he could understand the fear that the advanced technology of the USA inspired. Yet even they had lost much knowledge in the Collapse. It was what drove him to work 18-hour days on the site. If only they could discover more of the pre-Collapse science, find out how the fabled machinery of the time had worked. But for now they had the solid, reliable monsters of steam to do their bidding, giving US engineers an advantage over every civilization in the known world. Minutes to go now before they broke through. Just after dawn, a boiler had burst, sending scalding superheated steam spraying across the French workers who queued every morning for the chance to help out on the site, to earn real money. Three killed and another dozen horribly injured. The locals seemed inured to suffering. That was the first time he'd heard about the Curse of the Presidents. His local supervisor, Maxine, had explained it in her broken English. \u201cThey're superstitious, boss. Don't pay any attentions. This place ... they think their presidents \u2014 they were like the kings they had back then \u2014 are buried here. With their treasure. And if anyone breaks in, they suffer the curse. Die horribly. But really they are only saying this because they know it's impossible. For years they've tried to get to the treasure \u2014 and no one has ever got in.\u201d Howard nodded. The French would think it was about treasure. They probably expected to find golden statues and fancy tombs down under the thick concrete walls that sealed the site. But he knew better. This was no burial place of ancient presidents, it had to be where they'd stored their secrets. Their science and technology. There was a treasure house, for sure, but not the kind of thing the poor, ignorant locals imagined. The excavation engine's hooter gave off a dramatic blast. Howard smiled at Maxine. \u201cThey're close. We're nearly in.\u201d He scrambled down the carefully excavated incline. The blast sounded again. Howard looked back at Maxine, who was still at the top of the slope. Too scared to come closer. One of the US engineers was crouched by the monstrous teeth of the engine's main drill. All around were the remains of reinforced concrete, littering the excavation like rust-stained confetti. Abena, the engineer, tapped the wall straight in front of the bit. \u201cWe're there, chief. It's hollow behind. All it's going to take is one blow and we're through.\u201d Howard's smile turned into a broad grin. \u201cTime to make history, Abena.\u201d She handed him a chisel and a hammer. The daguerreotypers and newsgatherers crowded round to catch the moment. Howard turned to face his audience. \u201cThis is a great moment for the USA. We have come so far already, but with the technology we will discover inside this repository, we can regain the abilities our ancestors had before the Collapse. The time has come.\u201d Slowly, deliberately for the camera lucida, Howard placed the chisel against the wall and swung the hammer back, bringing it crashing into contact. A sheet of the thin concrete about two hand spans in width fell away, leaving a dark void beyond. Howard gestured eagerly behind him and Abena handed him a lantern. He held it to the hole, peering in above the lantern's chimney. \u201cCan you see anything?\u201d Abena hissed, pushing up behind him, trying to get a glimpse of the opening. Howard nodded. \u201cYes,\u201d he said, \u201cwonderful things.\u201d He had seen the shining metal containers, rust-free after so many years. Row, after row of them. Thousands upon thousands, like a buried army of knowledge. Howard stirred in his bed. He knew the burns were getting worse. He couldn't last much longer. He was dying. And for what? Because when they had opened those glittering containers, all they had found was more concrete. And inside that, industrial garbage. Gloves, protective clothing, wrecked equipment. Nothing of value. Even before the illness had struck, it was as if his life's work had been wasted. When he had heard about the total destruction of America and the devastation in Europe as a boy, he had known he was the one to bring back the knowledge, to make the United States of Africa what it once was. But it was not to be. Others were ill too. Three had died already. The Curse of the Presidents, it seemed, didn't care whether or not you believed.", "references": ["53e9a0dfb7602d97029c832e", "53e9bd98b7602d9704a3ed81", "53e9aac2b7602d970343e47f"]}

The technical hurdles are too high, critics say, and the financial incentives too low. A halfway house has been announced to offer encouragement: US$6 million for groups that can demonstrate that their lander works on Earth by September this year (see Nature 506, 278; 2014). By then, the X Prize model to encourage scientific progress could have launched its most successful venture yet. The word \u2018could\u2019 is pertinent, for the man talking up the chances of the venture is Richard Branson, the business tycoon with an ear for a catchy and ambitious sound bite. This is a man who does not do pessimism. Branson said in the British newspaper The Guardian last week that the maiden flight of his private suborbital space-plane will blast off later this year \u2014 and that he and his family will be on board. We have been here before. Branson first promised that his company Virgin Galactic would start its space rides for paying customers in 2007, and it has been selling tickets for a decade. He now says that work to launch the vehicle, SpaceShipTwo, is almost done. It is the successor to SpaceShipOne, which won the $10-million Ansari X Prize for repeatable space flight with a manned craft in 2004, and for which Virgin bought the rights. And Branson is typically bullish about the craft\u2019s prospects. The re-entry technology, always the most risky part, is foolproof, he claims: \u201cThe pilot could be sound asleep on re-entry.\u201d Branson wants SpaceShipTwo to fly to the edge of space \u201c100 times, maybe 1,000 times\u201d, he said. SpaceShipOne hangs from the ceiling of the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum in Washington DC, alongside the Spirit of St. Louis monoplane. SpaceShipTwo will have large windows, and white and silver seats. Engineers will customize those seats to the rears of the wealthy guests, to minimize the effects of g force and to allow them to get the most of their estimated five minutes of weightlessness. The Guardian spoke to astronaut Chris Hadfield, veteran of the NASA space shuttle and former commander of the International Space Station, who was sceptical of Branson\u2019s guarantees that nothing could go wrong. \u201cTo come into any programme with any vehicle and think you\u2019re somehow immune from what everybody else has always experienced with every machine in history is unrealistic,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t know everything yet.\u201d One thing that Branson does know (almost) everything about is how to keep a jumbo jet flying. As we report on page 420, that is more difficult than it sounds, particularly when the jet has a 2.5-metre infrared telescope sticking out of a hole in its fuselage. More than $1 billion has so far gone into the modified Boeing 747, formally called the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy. After years of delays (sound familiar?) it is now fully operational, and could do some valuable science. And with annual running costs of $78 million, it needs to. There is something brilliantly simple about sticking a telescope on an aircraft as a way to beat atmospheric interference. But in 2014, doesn\u2019t such a solution seem a bit, well, twentieth century? Back in the mid-1980s, Branson was invited by then Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev to become the first civilian in space. The ticket would have cost $50 million. \u201cI thought,\u201d Branson said, \u201cwouldn\u2019t it be better to spend that $50 million building a spaceship company instead?\u201d Optimism is not for everyone, but it has its benefits.", "references": ["53e9b6e1b7602d9704273c34", "53e9bbbcb7602d970480a624", "53e99e28b7602d97026ea15f", "53e9b35ab7602d9703e38c2b"]}

For example, the effects of genetic mutations can cascade through within-cell signaling and regulatory networks and alter the behavior of cells, possibly leading to a wide variety of diseases. The typical approach to mitigating network perturbations is to consider the compensatory activation or deactivation of system components. Here, we propose a complementary approach wherein interactions are instead modified to alter key regulatory functions and prevent the network damage from triggering a deregulatory cascade.We implement this approach in a Boolean dynamic framework, which has been shown to effectively model the behavior of biological regulatory and signaling networks. We show that the method can stabilize any single state (e.g., fixed point attractors or time-averaged representations of multi-state attractors) to be an attractor of the repaired network. We show that the approach is minimalistic in that few modifications are required to provide stability to a chosen attractor and specific in that interventions do not have undesired effects on the attractor. We apply the approach to random Boolean networks, and further show that the method can in some cases successfully repair synchronous limit cycles. We also apply the methodology to case studies from drought-induced signaling in plants and T-LGL leukemia and find that it is successful in both stabilizing desired behavior and in eliminating undesired outcomes. Code is made freely available through the software package BooleanNet.The methodology introduced in this report offers a complementary way to manipulating node expression levels. A comprehensive approach to evaluating network manipulation should take an \"all of the above\" perspective; we anticipate that theoretical studies of interaction modification, coupled with empirical advances, will ultimately provide researchers with greater flexibility in influencing system behavior.", "references": ["53e9aa86b7602d97033fc9c8", "53e9b289b7602d9703d32714", "53e9bbfbb7602d9704857cb2", "53e9af1fb7602d970395b79c", "53e9bc79b7602d97048f6b87", "55a4ed7765ceb7cb02dc3b5d", "53e99b78b7602d970241f119", "53e9ae04b7602d970380e1f7", "558cd16c15f38090e2f2a351", "53e9bb52b7602d970478f09a", "53e9b5d4b7602d970412164f", "53e9b861b7602d97044287d6", "56d81e98dabfae2eeeac0753", "53e9bcefb7602d9704974ad9", "53e9b221b7602d9703cbd637", "55a445a3612ca648688f3b5b", "53e9a2ceb7602d9702bd6c91", "55a4ef96c91bf3b1cc4a8d9f", "53e9b71cb7602d97042b139c", "55a4ea0365ceb7cb02dbe804", "53e9a5fdb7602d9702f29558", "56d824cadabfae2eeed5294e", "53e9b8aeb7602d970448a66d", "53e99c36b7602d97024e4ebd", "56d85930dabfae2eee412dd0", "53e9a1e6b7602d9702ae35be", "55a3bdf365ce5cd7b3b55fc2", "53e9a5a8b7602d9702ed20d9", "56d824ccdabfae2eeed5373f", "53e9b8f5b7602d97044d9d37", "53e9a9f7b7602d970335e2b5", "53e9a1a1b7602d9702a96de2", "53e9ae22b7602d9703834c02", "53e9bc15b7602d970487e8e2", "55a45a77c91b587b0978f59f", "53e9a90db7602d970325ea1a", "53e99c8bb7602d9702539072"]}

Recent developments have addressed applications such as quantifying the proportion of activity cliffs, investigating the predictive abilities of activity landscape methods and so on. However, all these publications have worked under the assumption that the activity landscape models are \"real\" (i.e., statistically significant).The current study addresses for the first time, in a quantitative manner, the significance of a landscape or individual cliffs in the landscape. In particular, we question whether the activity landscape derived from observed (experimental) activity data is different from a randomly generated landscape. To address this we used the SALI measure with six different data sets tested against one or more molecular targets. We also assessed the significance of the landscapes for single and multiple representations.We find that non-random landscapes are data set and molecular representation dependent. For the data sets and representations used in this work, our results suggest that not all representations lead to non-random landscapes. This indicates that not all molecular representations should be used to a) interpret the SAR and b) combined to generate consensus models. Our results suggest that significance testing of activity landscape models and in particular, activity cliffs, is key, prior to the use of such models.", "references": ["55a5ea6965cead59c82f6262", "53e99f4fb7602d970281fbdb", "53e9ae0bb7602d9703818fe9", "55a51aca65ceb7cb02e10aba", "53e9b8c1b7602d97044a1dcc", "55a47e4665ce31bc877cd876", "53e9a291b7602d9702b95d6e", "53e9a3abb7602d9702cb9d2d", "53e9b1c3b7602d9703c54ee6", "53e9a00ab7602d97028f071e", "56d90f52dabfae2eee3129c3", "53e9b622b7602d970417d01f", "53e9a9d3b7602d9703336152", "53e9af4cb7602d97039896c6", "53e9b56cb7602d97040a5b10", "55a4d54065ceb7cb02d9566f", "55a4a29065ceb7cb02d4e9fe", "55a471e765ce31bc877afa4e", "53e9b115b7602d9703b956ca", "53e9acccb7602d97036ab961", "53e9a569b7602d9702e90a27", "56d81c8edabfae2eee9e5b3e", "56d8e222dabfae2eee1967fb", "55a3cafa65ce5cd7b3b7ebd1", "55a3cafa65ce5cd7b3b7ebd2", "56d8f47cdabfae2eee8a4331", "56d85bdfdabfae2eee559851", "53e9a8f1b7602d9703241792", "56d84f6ddabfae2eeef727ec", "56d8910cdabfae2eeee83397", "56d8f473dabfae2eee8a109f", "55a43c7dc91b587b0972fc94", "53e9b861b7602d970442b2d4"]}

Solely four axioms guarantee the optimality in terms of the error estimators. Compared to the state of the art in the temporary literature, the improvements of this article can be summarized as follows: First, a general framework is presented which covers the existing literature on optimality of adaptive schemes. The abstract analysis covers linear as well as nonlinear problems and is independent of the underlying finite element or boundary element method. Second, efficiency of the error estimator is neither needed to prove convergence nor quasi-optimal convergence behavior of the error estimator. In this paper, efficiency exclusively characterizes the approximation classes involved in terms of the best-approximation error and data resolution and so the upper bound on the optimal marking parameters does not depend on the efficiency constant. Third, some general quasi-Galerkin orthogonality is not only sufficient, but also necessary for the [Formula: see text]-linear convergence of the error estimator, which is a fundamental ingredient in the current quasi-optimality analysis due to Stevenson 2007. Finally, the general analysis allows for equivalent error estimators and inexact solvers as well as different non-homogeneous and mixed boundary conditions.", "references": ["53e99d58b7602d970261216b", "56d92a4cdabfae2eeed49ee0", "53e9a33cb7602d9702c44b24", "53e9a66db7602d9702f9cacd", "53e9a682b7602d9702fb468c", "53e9b002b7602d9703a59884", "53e99c74b7602d9702523a22", "53e99d7ab7602d9702632326", "53e9adf0b7602d97037f8da9", "53e9af7bb7602d97039c2edd", "53e9a1e7b7602d9702ae8524", "53e9bb80b7602d97047c4c40", "53e9a14db7602d9702a40c12", "53e9b929b7602d9704514623", "53e9abc9b7602d9703580020", "53e9b8c0b7602d970449cc0a", "53e9b79fb7602d9704345e2a", "55922f420cf2ceaae74c8ebe", "53e998c7b7602d9702101faf", "53e9bb61b7602d97047a1dba", "53e9b350b7602d9703e2a4de", "56d92a4cdabfae2eeed49e9e", "53e9aa95b7602d970340ddcc", "53e9a8c5b7602d9703215020", "53e9b41ab7602d9703f0ef09", "53e9b775b7602d970431d60e", "558bff030cf25dbdbb050bb4", "53e9abc9b7602d970357b1c0", "53e9a308b7602d9702c0fd11", "56d8e280dabfae2eee1b9384", "558bdaac0cf2e30013db20ac", "53e9a4e4b7602d9702e02381", "53e9afa0b7602d97039ee139", "56d8f158dabfae2eee76f096", "53e9a7feb7602d970313f009", "53e9b549b7602d970407ebe0", "53e9a7c1b7602d9703101fbe", "53e9b709b7602d97042a1b87", "53e9a841b7602d970318a350", "53e9ab37b7602d97034c2712", "53e9b732b7602d97042cbcdc", "53e9a2bab7602d9702bc3f9b", "53e9a38fb7602d9702c9bfb8", "53e9a5afb7602d9702ed9976", "53e9be21b7602d9704ada409", "55323bdc45cec66b6f9dabfc"]}

Consequently, both the infiltrating and fibrosing elements of the disease promote end organ damage and ultimately, failure. Presentation of the Erdheim-Chester disease typically involves longstanding diabetes insipidus in conjunction with intensifying bone pain that classically affects the femurs and tibiae. Alternatively, the disease may present with neurological deterioration of cerebellar nature. Thus, a high index of clinical suspicion is required when facing a patient with the combination of longstanding diabetes insipidus in conjunction with bone pain or cerebellar dysfunction. Typical symmetric, bilateral increased tracer uptake on a 99mTc bone scintigraphy invoLving the femurs and tibiae, is strongly suggestive of the Erdheim-Chester disease. interferon alpha is considered as the first line of treatment.

In Experiment I, participants watched short videos of an operator performing a supervisory control task, and then the participants were either interrupted or not interrupted, after which SA was assessed using a questionnaire. In Experiment 2, participants performed a supervisory control task in which they guided vehicles to their respective targets and either experienced an interruption, during which they performed a visual search task in a different panel, or were not interrupted.The SAR processes we identified included shorter fixation durations, increased number of objects scanned, longer resumption lags, and a greater likelihood of refixating on objects that were previously looked at.We interpret these findings in terms of the memory-for-goals model, which suggests that SAR consists of increased scanning in order to compensate for decay, and previously viewed cues act as associative primes that reactivate memory traces of goals and plans.", "references": ["53e9a003b7602d97028e62a0", "53e99f77b7602d9702849898", "53e9ae4fb7602d970386b629", "53e9b93eb7602d970452c8a3", "53e9bcb3b7602d9704935b20", "53e99d87b7602d970264186e", "53e9ac43b7602d9703612312", "56d82fa3dabfae2eee19f319", "53e9bc3bb7602d97048b1c69", "53e9ac8fb7602d9703664e76", "53e9acfeb7602d97036dfbbc", "53e9abcfb7602d9703581e83", "53e9be57b7602d9704b190e5", "53e9a108b7602d97029f6018", "56d88124dabfae2eee68c5c8", "53e99e1ab7602d97026dc9b6", "56d84ddddabfae2eeeebd37c", "53e9a1dbb7602d9702ada378", "53e9b6eeb7602d970427eb51", "53e9acbcb7602d9703698208", "53e9b910b7602d97044f58ae", "53e9b13eb7602d9703bbf29e", "53e99ccab7602d970257e678", "53e9b350b7602d9703e270c2"]}

Meanwhile, there are now many potential applications that involve aspects of both recommendation and information retrieval, and the task of collaborative retrieval-a combination of these two traditional problems-has recently been introduced. Successful collaborative retrieval requires overcoming severe data sparsity, making additional sources of information, such as social graphs, particularly valuable. In this paper we propose a new model for collaborative retrieval, and show that our algorithm outperforms current state-of-the-art approaches by incorporating information from social networks. We also provide empirical analyses of the ways in which cultural interests propagate along a social graph using a real-world music dataset.", "references": ["53e99adcb7602d970235d207", "53e9b6d0b7602d970425a8a4", "53e9a570b7602d9702e9a355", "56d8f8b2dabfae2eeea48e96", "53e9983db7602d9702065035", "53e9aec4b7602d97038ee6c7", "53e9af61b7602d97039a0778", "53e997ccb7602d9701fbec7a", "53e9acb6b7602d9703696d12", "53e9bcfcb7602d97049821d6", "53e9983db7602d9702064e12", "53e9a594b7602d9702ebe431", "53e99ae2b7602d9702369ac7", "53e99905b7602d970213f87c", "53e9b388b7602d9703e6c16a", "53e9ad98b7602d9703792cf3", "53e9bdeeb7602d9704a9f4a4", "53e9bb36b7602d9704775f33", "53e9a618b7602d9702f46e06", "53e9b6eeb7602d970427e609", "53e99d6cb7602d9702628665", "53e9ab89b7602d9703535cc7", "53e9aae5b7602d9703462f7c", "53e9bd7bb7602d9704a20355", "55323bdc45cec66b6f9dabfc"]}

However, they lack information of the entire object. In this paper, we propose a method to obtain superpixels through a merging strategy based on the bottom-up saliency values of superpixels. The proposed method aims to obtain meaningful superpixels, i.e., make the objects as complete as possible. The proposed method creates an over-segmented representation of an image. The saliency value of each superpixel is calculated through a biologically plausible saliency model in a way of statistical theory. Two adjacent superpixels are merged if the merged superpixel is more salient than the unmerged ones. The merging process is performed in an iterative way. Experimental evaluation on test images shows that the obtained saliency-based superpixels can extract the salient objects more effectively than the existing methods. ? 2013 Springer-Verlag London.", "references": ["53e9aca1b7602d970367b1f4", "53e9a0c9b7602d97029b0073", "53e9a5f6b7602d9702f22eef", "53e9b78ab7602d9704334b3a", "53e9ac05b7602d97035c8331", "53e99b3cb7602d97023da860", "53e9ae1cb7602d9703829bde", "53e9b15ab7602d9703bdefa0", "53e9bcfcb7602d9704981600", "53e9a2c8b7602d9702bd0db9", "53e9b4ceb7602d9703fed433", "53e9b5e0b7602d970412da0b", "53e9bdfdb7602d9704aacd0a", "53e99de2b7602d97026a5fe5", "53e9b239b7602d9703cd6d28", "53e9b2e5b7602d9703d998bf", "53e9af2db7602d9703969677", "53e9b51bb7602d970404b276", "53e99e3eb7602d9702704003", "53e9a3b9b7602d9702cca9e1", "53e9bd87b7602d9704a2b6b4", "53e9b29cb7602d9703d4283d", "53e9a309b7602d9702c15701", "53e9b768b7602d970430e41c", "53e9a401b7602d9702d182d1", "53e9b86db7602d9704436c01", "53e9ba2db7602d970463a139", "53e9b95bb7602d97045490fb", "53e9a6d1b7602d9703008c36", "53e9a7d5b7602d970311389e", "53e99cc9b7602d970257be34", "53e9afe8b7602d9703a3af5a", "53e9b5b6b7602d97040fbfd2", "53e9bd59b7602d97049f2b4a", "53e9b8b3b7602d970448d966", "53e9b52cb7602d970405ff52", "55a37f232401aa93797a5d8e", "53e9b8dab7602d97044babaf", "558c1cbbe4b0cfb70a1bb4a2", "53e9a7f8b7602d970313bfa7"]}

However, there seems to be an increasing interest in developing PASs that can be used also after further reduction of residual plasma content below 15-20% plasma. Inclusion of glucose but also calcium and bicarbonate in such solutions have been suggested to improve platelet (PLT) storage, especially when plasma content is reduced to very low levels. Results from a limited number of studies using novel PAS alternatives have been presented during the last years, such as InterSol-G, PAS-5, M-sol, PAS-G and SAS. Most of them are experimental solutions. The combined results presented in those studies suggest that presence of glucose may be necessary during PLT storage, primarily to maintain ATP at acceptable levels. At plasma inclusion below 15-20%, the content of glucose will generally be too low to support PLT metabolism for more than a few days making glucose addition in PAS necessary. Significant effects associated with presence of calcium was observed in PLTs stored in PAS with 5% inclusion but not with 20-35% plasma inclusion, suggesting that the content of plasma could be of importance. Bicarbonate only seems to be of importance for pH regulation, primarily when plasma inclusion is reduced to about 5%. Reduction in rate of glycolysis was observed in some PAS alternatives containing potassium and magnesium but not in others. Differences in pH or in concentrations of the various compounds included in PAS may be possible explanations. Additionally, novel PAS containing glucose, calcium and bicarbonate does not seem to be associated with improved in vitro results as compared to SSP+ or CompoSol when PLTs are stored with 35% plasma inclusion. The results would then also suggest that excess of glucose in novel PAS environment may not be associated with additional positive effects on PLT metabolism. This review is based on the few publications on novel PAS available, and additional studies would be needed in the future.", "references": ["53e9af7bb7602d97039bff8c", "53e9a6d0b7602d970300314d", "55a3e0cf2401c6de3b78371f", "53e9a217b7602d9702b1d37d", "53e9aadfb7602d970345daf3", "53e9a6b4b7602d9702fe561b", "53e99eeeb7602d97027bc012", "55a66190612ca6eebaae4f4c", "53e99bc6b7602d9702472bae", "53e9a20fb7602d9702b0fff9", "53e9ad77b7602d97037692ec", "53e9a9beb7602d970331ae88", "53e9b12ab7602d9703bac813", "53e9ab78b7602d970351e0c3"]}
