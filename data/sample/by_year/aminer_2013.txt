The underlying structures are typically complex and their most relevant organizational principle is the ordering of the ties among the units they are made of according to a network displaying hierarchical features. In spite of the abundant presence of hierarchy no quantitative theoretical interpretation of the origins of a multi-level, knowledge-based social network exists. Here we introduce an approach which is capable of reproducing the emergence of a multi-levelled network structure based on the plausible assumption that the individuals (representing the nodes of the network) can make the right estimate about the state of their changing environment to a varying degree. Our model accounts for a fundamental feature of knowledge-based organizations: the less capable individuals tend to follow those who are better at solving the problems they all face. We find that relatively simple rules lead to hierarchical self-organization and the specific structures we obtain possess the two, perhaps most important features of complex systems: a simultaneous presence of adaptability and stability. In addition, the performance (success score) of the emerging networks is significantly higher than the average expected score of the individuals without letting them copy the decisions of the others. The results of our calculations are in agreement with a related experiment and can be useful from the point of designing the optimal conditions for constructing a given complex social structure as well as understanding the hierarchical organization of such biological structures of major importance as the regulatory pathways or the dynamics of neural networks.", "references": ["56d818e4dabfae2eee859cc2", "53e99854b7602d970208c623", "53e99f19b7602d97027e6c93", "53e9ade9b7602d97037f1b38", "53e997f8b7602d9701ffcb08", "53e9a3e7b7602d9702cfdc6c", "53e9a26bb7602d9702b73635", "56d8189adabfae2eee835fea", "53e9b532b7602d9704068c99", "53e9b581b7602d97040bfe68", "56d818b7dabfae2eee8438e5", "53e9a9ebb7602d97033507f4", "56d8b29bdabfae2eeeee091a", "53e9bb08b7602d9704740805", "56d818e3dabfae2eee859591", "53e99866b7602d97020a059e", "56d8b641dabfae2eee0a9a54", "56d8aacedabfae2eeeb16318", "53e9aaecb7602d97034709e2", "53e9afeeb7602d9703a41cd3", "53e9ac8fb7602d97036659e1"]}

However, the ever-increasing size of the scientific literature limits the 'findability' of new results. Additionally, collaborative projects can obscure which ideas, technical expertise and motivations individual scientists bring to specific publications, particularly for journals that do not publish author contribution statements. Some efforts, such as contributions to databases or software code, can also be difficult to encapsulate in formal publications. Yet as the unique capabilities and accomplishments of each particular scientist become more difficult to parse out, their importance in determining future opportunities is only increasing. As a result, scientists need to be proactive in making themselves known online. In the past, scientists typically introduced themselves to their community by attending conferences and giving talks, but these efforts only reached a comparatively small number of people. As printed departmental brochures became obsolete, laboratory websites were created to provide basic information about faculty research activities. Although some scientists have embraced websites, networking tools and other technology, too many scientists are hidden\u2014by choice or by accident\u2014behind outdated websites or confusing directories or through a simple absence of information. As a result, these scientists are missing opportunities to gain a potentially larger audience through a relatively small amount of effort. Why take to the web? Students may want to know more about a prospective advisor, whereas faculty who are seeking new collaborators or departments searching for senior hires want to learn about your expertise and research aims. Reporters may seek experts to offer opinions or want to communicate your research to the general public, but they may lack contact information or context for your latest paper. As journal editors, we look online for potential referees and authors of commissioned pieces as well as for people and topics to highlight in the journal's pages. Thus, your ability to conduct your research and share your ideas is directly affected by your online presence. Creating a new website or updating an existing site is an obvious first step in this process. A good basic website will include: Keep in mind that online tools have made it straightforward to translate web pages, even those containing technical jargon, so a website can be constructed in your native language with the critical caveat that the site itself needs to be findable in multiple languages. Unsure if you're inadvertently in hiding? Ask external colleagues to search for you online and report back. In our experience, searching for a specific, sometimes very common name can be difficult across languages; adding an institutional affiliation or e-mail address can provide confidence that the correct site has been reached. Similarly, some university systems or research organizations are extremely difficult to navigate for external users. If your institution has many acronyms, nested departments or other layers of complexity, consider creating a stand-alone website that links to your organizational website. Finally, corporate websites rarely feature scientific researchers, and the unclear internal hierarchies at companies may make it difficult to determine whether the corresponding author of a paper has the expertise sought. As a result, industrial researchers who want to stay engaged with the larger scientific community should also consider how they can become more findable. Beyond your personal website, there are many ways to take ownership of your electronic self. Consider creating a profile on existing networking platforms, such as ResearchGate (http://www.researchgate.net/), LinkedIn (http://www.linkedin.com/) or BiomedExperts (http://www.biomedexperts.com/). The Open Researcher and Contributor ID (ORCID; http://orcid.org/) organization similarly allows scientists to create an online profile but also assigns each person a unique identifying number (disclosure: Nature Publishing Group is a member of this organization and has a seat on ORCID's board of directors). This kind of identifier can both improve findability by linking publications and other output in the short term and support the development of new mechanisms to assign credit for scientific work in the longer term. Some scientific groups, such as CAZypedia (http://www.cazypedia.org) or OpenWetWare (http://openwetware.org), also allow participants to create user pages where they can describe their interests and activity with the group. Asking colleagues what venues they find valuable can also help you explore new ways to connect online. Research is time intensive, and scientists have a variety of nontrivial reasons to put off what may seem like a nonessential task. However, most of the information described above is already collated on your CV, whereas extensions such as animated videos that augment your research summary or photos of the lab's last hiking trip that might give interested students a better idea of lab life can be introduced as time allows. Similarly, updates can be relatively infrequent: at a minimum, add recent publications and review your research summary a few times each year. Finally, future technologies, presumably still Internet-based, will most likely build on current information and platforms, so time spent now will better prepare you to use new frameworks. For now, however, we hope you find that these simple suggestions for maintaining your online presence will allow you to share and advance your research in our increasingly connected world.", "references": ["53e9a310b7602d9702c1d567", "53e9bc61b7602d97048d8048", "53e9a584b7602d9702ead7c5"]}

The founder decides between hiring a professional manager or leaving management to his heir, as well as on how much, if any, of the shares to float on the stock exchange. We assume that a professional is a better manager than the heir, and describe how the founder's decision is shaped by the legal environment. Specifically, we show that, in legal regimes that successfully limit the expropriation of minority shareholders, the widely held professionally managed corporation emerges as the equilibrium outcome. In legal regimes with intermediate protection, management is delegated to a professional, but the family stays on as large shareholders to monitor the manager. In legal regimes with the weakest protection, the founder designates his heir to manage and ownership remains inside the family. This theory of separation of ownership from management includes the Anglo-Saxon and the Continental European patterns of corporate governance as special cases, and generates additional empirical predictions consistent with cross-country evidence.", "references": ["53e9a751b7602d97030879b9", "53e9b999b7602d970458bd0a", "53e9985fb7602d970209b235", "53e9b8c0b7602d970449cd9c", "53e9a3dbb7602d9702cef06f", "53e9b350b7602d9703e28c2e", "53e9bbe0b7602d970482f915", "53e9bbfbb7602d970485a9ce", "53e9ae1cb7602d9703830e48", "53e9a317b7602d9702c21b6d", "53e9a317b7602d9702c21b6c", "53e9afbab7602d9703a0ad7d", "53e9a327b7602d9702c32e70", "53e9af87b7602d97039d0890", "53e9a79eb7602d97030d9193", "53e9b71cb7602d97042b2e50", "53e9ae1cb7602d9703830f49", "53e9a727b7602d970305db64", "53e9a18db7602d9702a82a22", "53e9b338b7602d9703e0db56", "53e9983db7602d97020657f7", "53e9b984b7602d9704576be4", "53e9ad2db7602d9703712a4f", "53e99af2b7602d970238146f", "53e9ac54b7602d9703625642", "53e9a93eb7602d9703293398"]}

Proteins like GTPases often detect the difference between NDP and NTP and respond by changing conformations. To study such complexes, simple, fixed charge force fields have been used, which allow long simulations and precise free energy calculations. The preference for NTP or NDP binding depends on many factors, including ligand structure and Mg(2+) coordination and the changes they undergo upon binding. Here, we use a simple force field to examine two Mg(2+) coordination modes for the unbound GDP and GTP: direct, or \"Inner Sphere\" (IS) coordination by one or more phosphate oxygens and indirect, \"Outer Sphere\" (OS) coordination involving one or more bridging waters. We compare GTP: and GDP:Mg binding with OS and IS coordination; combining the results with experimental data then indicates that GTP prefers the latter. We also examine different kinds of IS coordination and their sensitivity to a key force field parameter: the optimal Mg:oxygen van der Waals distance Rmin . Increasing Rmin improves the Mg:oxygen distances, the GTP: and GDP:Mg binding affinities, and the fraction of GTP:Mg with \u03b2 + \u03b3 phosphate coordination, but does not improve or change the GTP/GDP affinity difference, which remains much larger than experiment.

Existing design methods for three-stage OTAs often lead to sub-optimal solutions because they decouple inter-related metrics like noise and settling performance. In our approach, the problem of finding an optimal design with the best total integrated noise and settling time has been cohesively solved by formulating a nonlinear constrained optimization program. Equality, inequality, and semi-infinite constraints are formed using closed form symbolic expressions obtained by a closed loop analysis of the SC gain stage and the optimization program is solved by using the interior-point algorithm. For the optimization routine, there is no need to interface with a circuit simulator because all significant device parasitics are included in the model. The optimization and modeling steps are general in nature and can be applied to any amplifier or filter topology. Simulation results show that a 90-nm prototype amplifier achieves a dynamic error settling time of 2.5 ns with a total integrated noise of 240 , while consuming 5.2 mW from a 1-V power supply.", "references": ["53e9a22cb7602d9702b33000"]}

It is based on the alpha shape theory and proceeds in three steps. First, we compute the weighted Delaunay triangulation of the union of spheres representing the molecule. In the second step, the Delaunay complex is filtered to derive the dual complex. Finally, contacts between spheres are collected. In this approach, two atoms i and j are defined to be in contact if their centers are connected by an edge in the dual complex. The contact areas between atom i and its neighbors are computed based on the caps formed by these neighbors on the surface of i; the total area of all these caps is partitioned according to their spherical Laguerre Voronoi diagram on the surface of i. This method is analytical and its implementation in a new program BallContact is fast and robust. We have used BallContact to study contacts in a database of 1551 high resolution protein structures. We show that with this new definition of atomic contacts, we generate realistic representations of the environments of atoms and residues within a protein. In particular, we establish the importance of nonpolar contact areas that complement the information represented by the accessible surface areas. This new method bears similarity to the tessellation methods used to quantify atomic volumes and contacts, with the advantage that it does not require the presence of explicit solvent molecules if the surface of the protein is to be considered. \u00a9 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.", "references": ["53e9b607b7602d970415c7ce", "53e99fa2b7602d9702876e73", "53e9b408b7602d9703efac8a", "53e9b593b7602d97040d8e30", "53e9bc9db7602d970491b37f", "53e9ad9eb7602d970379a454", "53e9a6a0b7602d9702fd5247", "53e9b822b7602d97043d8c70", "53e9a1f3b7602d9702af60f4", "53e9b421b7602d9703f1728f", "53e9b2dbb7602d9703d8d8aa", "53e9af0db7602d9703945009", "53e9a562b7602d9702e8a1d3", "53e9a7a5b7602d97030e2921", "53e9bb29b7602d9704765acf", "53e9a263b7602d9702b6901f", "53e9b9c1b7602d97045b6541", "53e9b0b2b7602d9703b1d446", "53e9b33db7602d9703e12c97", "53e9aa42b7602d97033b2a84", "53e9a8eab7602d970323a9e2", "53e9b6eeb7602d970428127e", "53e9b098b7602d9703b03dde", "53e9a8a9b7602d97031f55c4", "53e9afe8b7602d9703a3b0a9", "53e9a0fbb7602d97029e5316", "53e9b173b7602d9703bf992d", "53e998a2b7602d97020d945d", "53e9b0edb7602d9703b6a221", "53e9b2ffb7602d9703dc48f9", "56d818b6dabfae2eee842bfb", "53e9afeeb7602d9703a412ef", "53e9bd2bb7602d97049ba466"]}

Most current approaches to multisource clustering either independently determine a separate clustering for each data source or determine a single 'joint' clustering for all data sources. There is a need for more flexible approaches that simultaneously model the dependence and the heterogeneity of the data sources.We propose an integrative statistical model that permits a separate clustering of the objects for each data source. These separate clusterings adhere loosely to an overall consensus clustering, and hence they are not independent. We describe a computationally scalable Bayesian framework for simultaneous estimation of both the consensus clustering and the source-specific clusterings. We demonstrate that this flexible approach is more robust than joint clustering of all data sources, and is more powerful than clustering each data source independently.

During training, the losses are minimized via keeping an adaptive weight distribution over the training samples, similar to Boosting methods. In order to keep the method as flexible and general as possible, we adopt the principle of employing gradient descent in function space, which allows to minimize arbitrary losses. Contrary to Boosted Trees, in our method the loss minimization is an inherent part of the tree growing process, thus allowing to keep the benefits of common Random Forests, such as, parallel processing. We derive the new classifier and give a discussion and evaluation on standard machine learning data sets. Furthermore, we show how ADFs can be easily integrated into an object detection application. Compared to both, standard Random Forests and Boosted Trees, ADFs give better performance in our experiments, while yielding more compact models in terms of tree depth.", "references": ["53e9b5afb7602d97040f83a4", "53e9b808b7602d97043bdbd8", "53e9bb23b7602d9704760af9", "53e99bfeb7602d97024a6a2a", "53e99fc2b7602d9702899ee6", "53e9ab1ab7602d970349e263", "53e99eb5b7602d970277f518", "53e9a102b7602d97029f0a33", "53e99a57b7602d97022c087d", "53e99998b7602d97021da116", "557d23dcf667eeed561982f7", "53e9a95eb7602d97032b8415", "53e9a6d0b7602d970300410c", "53e99ad1b7602d9702353c4a", "53e99f27b7602d97027f394e", "53e9a24db7602d9702b57dcf", "53e9a593b7602d9702eb9e98", "53e99e21b7602d97026e7dba", "53e9ba4eb7602d970466442f", "53e9ad2db7602d970370e346", "53e9acc3b7602d970369e2c6", "53e9affab7602d9703a521ee", "53e9a6adb7602d9702fde64d", "53e99af7b7602d9702384381", "53e9bc5bb7602d97048d2937", "53e9a388b7602d9702c9a725", "53e9ac76b7602d9703649481"]}

However, bio-event annotation alone cannot cater for all the needs of biologists. Unlike work on relation and event extraction, most of which focusses on specific events and named entities, we aim to build a comprehensive resource, covering all statements of causal association present in discourse. Causality lies at the heart of biomedical knowledge, such as diagnosis, pathology or systems biology, and, thus, automatic causality recognition can greatly reduce the human workload by suggesting possible causal connections and aiding in the curation of pathway models. A biomedical text corpus annotated with such relations is, hence, crucial for developing and evaluating biomedical text mining.We have defined an annotation scheme for enriching biomedical domain corpora with causality relations. This schema has subsequently been used to annotate 851 causal relations to form BioCause, a collection of 19 open-access full-text biomedical journal articles belonging to the subdomain of infectious diseases. These documents have been pre-annotated with named entity and event information in the context of previous shared tasks. We report an inter-annotator agreement rate of over 60% for triggers and of over 80% for arguments using an exact match constraint. These increase significantly using a relaxed match setting. Moreover, we analyse and describe the causality relations in BioCause from various points of view. This information can then be leveraged for the training of automatic causality detection systems.Augmenting named entity and event annotations with information about causal discourse relations could benefit the development of more sophisticated IE systems. These will further influence the development of multiple tasks, such as enabling textual inference to detect entailments, discovering new facts and providing new hypotheses for experimental work.", "references": ["53e9b65bb7602d97041bac9e", "53e9b9e7b7602d97045e1613", "53e9a9beb7602d970331b0bb", "53e9b253b7602d9703cf2ed2", "53e9b59bb7602d97040e1138", "53e9a1fbb7602d9702affe1f", "53e99976b7602d97021baa1a", "56d8e886dabfae2eee410853", "53e9ace8b7602d97036c5b07", "53e9afb3b7602d97039ffa7a", "53e9b098b7602d9703b04451", "55a511d7c91bf3b1cc4de74f", "53e9a335b7602d9702c40e10", "56d8d550dabfae2eeec67696", "53e9b0b7b7602d9703b29b47", "53e9b76eb7602d97043154c3", "53e99859b7602d9702095728", "53e9a343b7602d9702c4bf52", "53e99893b7602d97020caf0d", "53e9a2ebb7602d9702bf2a76", "53e99924b7602d970215d908", "53e9b355b7602d9703e2fc79", "53e99c67b7602d970251ab01", "53e9ad3bb7602d970371bd01", "53e9bda5b7602d9704a50b97", "53e9bdc6b7602d9704a7661c", "55a5d107612c6b12ab2e562c", "53e9b9b9b7602d97045ad7b1", "53e9badfb7602d970470e6bd", "53e9adc2b7602d97037c4827", "53e9aeddb7602d97039072e3", "53e9af06b7602d970393b59d", "53e99f4fb7602d97028207e2", "53e9a455b7602d9702d76025", "53e9a515b7602d9702e38178", "54890fbf45ce471f90ab7502", "53e9af00b7602d9703933b60", "53e9a374b7602d9702c7d519", "53e9a735b7602d970306f1ac", "53e9bbfbb7602d9704857f21", "53e9b917b7602d9704501532", "56d8f62bdabfae2eee94a0e0", "53e9b18fb7602d9703c177f1", "53e99b4ab7602d97023ef0e1", "53e9bb37b7602d97047774b2", "53e9999eb7602d97021e5cae", "53e99f64b7602d9702835b87", "56d88530dabfae2eee876e32", "53e99c58b7602d9702505f8c", "53e9ae63b7602d970387fd1e", "53e99c75b7602d970252576d", "53e9b0d1b7602d9703b4d1e4", "53e9b8bab7602d9704499962", "53e998f0b7602d970212f4f3", "53e9b3c7b7602d9703eb0b35", "53e9b289b7602d9703d2cee6", "53e99d3eb7602d97025f6230", "53e9bb53b7602d970479573e", "53e9b88bb7602d970445b3c2", "53e9be1ab7602d9704ad3c02"]}

Over the years several methods have been proposed for extracting a hierarchy between the tags for systems with a \"flat\", egalitarian organization of the tags, which is very common when the tags correspond to free words given by numerous independent people. Here we present a complete framework for automated tag hierarchy extraction based on tag occurrence statistics. Along with proposing new algorithms, we are also introducing different quality measures enabling the detailed comparison of competing approaches from different aspects. Furthermore, we set up a synthetic, computer generated benchmark providing a versatile tool for testing, with a couple of tunable parameters capable of generating a wide range of test beds. Beside the computer generated input we also use real data in our studies, including a biological example with a pre-defined hierarchy between the tags. The encouraging similarity between the pre-defined and reconstructed hierarchy, as well as the seemingly meaningful hierarchies obtained for other real systems indicate that tag hierarchy extraction is a very promising direction for further research with a great potential for practical applications. Tags have become very prevalent nowadays in various online platforms ranging from blogs through scientific publications to protein databases. Furthermore, tagging systems dedicated for voluntary tagging of photos, films, books, etc. with free words are also becoming popular. The emerging large collections of tags associated with different objects are often referred to as folksonomies, highlighting their collaborative origin and the \"flat\" organization of the tags opposed to traditional hierarchical categorization. Adding a tag hierarchy corresponding to a given folksonomy can very effectively help narrowing or broadening the scope of search. Moreover, recommendation systems could also benefit from a tag hierarchy.", "references": ["53e9afadb7602d97039fc2f1", "53e9b7d9b7602d97043893f4", "53e9a21db7602d9702b21ebe", "56d818e3dabfae2eee859591", "53e9a37ab7602d9702c86cb7", "53e9b4efb7602d970401a8c3", "53e9ba05b7602d9704605705", "53e999ffb7602d970224a6b7", "53e9aaecb7602d97034709e2", "53e9a49cb7602d9702dba557", "53e9b6a7b7602d9704220fa7", "53e9bb2fb7602d970476ca7f", "56d90aa7dabfae2eee14cb83", "53e99924b7602d970216290e", "53e99ac4b7602d970234115d", "53e9a9ebb7602d9703350306", "53e99998b7602d97021de15f", "56d81877dabfae2eee823744", "53e9a0fcb7602d97029e937d", "55a402c065ce5cd7b3c05fd1", "56d91eb2dabfae2eee8ff157", "53e9b95bb7602d9704547d40", "53e9baf6b7602d97047282a3", "53e99de2b7602d97026a5918", "53e9b4d4b7602d9703ff7208", "53e9b550b7602d9704087131", "53e9a169b7602d9702a5bf6f", "53e9abe0b7602d970359c49d", "53e99a73b7602d97022e24af", "53e99c36b7602d97024e4ebd", "53e9ac33b7602d97035f8c9d", "56d8189adabfae2eee835fea", "53e9b532b7602d9704068c99", "53e999ffb7602d970224995e", "53e9a9ebb7602d97033507f4", "56d8aacedabfae2eeeb16318", "53e9a0bbb7602d97029a4333", "53e9a63db7602d9702f69b08"]}

However, this procedure does not necessarily work well because the first step is performed without regard to the second step, and thus a small estimation error incurred in the first stage can cause a big error in the second stage. In this letter, we propose a single-shot procedure for directly estimating the density difference without separately estimating two densities. We derive a nonparametric finite-sample error bound for the proposed single-shot density-difference estimator and show that it achieves the optimal convergence rate. We then show how the proposed density-difference estimator can be used in L\u00b2-distance approximation. Finally, we experimentally demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed method in robust distribution comparison such as class-prior estimation and change-point detection.", "references": ["53e9af00b7602d9703931a8d", "56d89142dabfae2eeee9e82e", "53e9afadb7602d97039fd82c", "53e99bdcb7602d970248324c", "53e9a3f4b7602d9702d0b56b", "53e9bb67b7602d97047ab3a1", "56d84cb4dabfae2eeee32c94", "53e99b26b7602d97023c2fac", "53e9a6bbb7602d9702feec82", "53e99822b7602d9702040e8f", "53e9bb72b7602d97047b49a9", "53e9b017b7602d9703a6e908", "53e9b7c1b7602d970436bb9c", "53e9b4e9b7602d9704013f8a", "53e99822b7602d9702044fe0", "53e9ae5cb7602d9703876bae", "53e9b8c1b7602d97044a0dd8", "53e99822b7602d9702042f69", "53e9bc10b7602d97048745cf", "53e9ad98b7602d9703794083", "56d83a66dabfae2eee5bceb1", "56d8cd0ddabfae2eee84efbf", "53e9ad0ab7602d97036eab8b", "53e9b94db7602d9704539333", "53e9a7b3b7602d97030f2609", "53e9aff4b7602d9703a4c4ea", "53e9b16db7602d9703bf36c3", "56d83a66dabfae2eee5bd151", "53e99a14b7602d9702267be8", "53e9b7b4b7602d970435f8e1", "53e9a343b7602d9702c4b678", "53e9be57b7602d9704b1a1c2", "53e99a7fb7602d97022f1f0e", "55323bdc45cec66b6f9dabfc", "53e9ad8db7602d9703786ba9", "53e9abd4b7602d970358ca61", "53e99b21b7602d97023ba518", "56d8ca61dabfae2eee70888a", "53e99822b7602d970204503f", "53e9a698b7602d9702fc991b", "56d8ceefdabfae2eee93f5ab", "53e9b6f3b7602d9704285fb7", "53e9ae76b7602d9703894d73", "53e99acab7602d970234830a", "53e9a41cb7602d9702d38430", "53e99f69b7602d970283b36f", "53e9af87b7602d97039cf427", "53e9b4d9b7602d9703ffcb42", "53e9a90db7602d970325c0c4", "56d81c06dabfae2eee9abfcc", "53e9ab4fb7602d97034e127b", "56d8b565dabfae2eee041393", "53e99d0cb7602d97025bf7d5", "53e9ae36b7602d970384d90f", "53e9a17fb7602d9702a7513d", "53e99bf7b7602d970249f469", "53e9a930b7602d970328036d", "56d8d1b3dabfae2eeea95dd1", "53e99bc6b7602d970246be2c", "53e99ae6b7602d970236c618", "56d87c11dabfae2eee42ae5e", "53e99d1ab7602d97025ce3c8", "53e9a965b7602d97032bc8a8", "53e9aba4b7602d970354f17c"]}

As a polysomnographic finding, central apneas occur in many pathophysiological conditions. Depending on the cause or mechanism, central apneas may not be clinically significant, for example, those that occur normally at sleep onset. In contrast, central apneas occur in a number of disorders and result in pathophysiological consequences. Central apneas occur commonly in high-altitude sojourn, disrupt sleep, and cause desaturation. Central sleep apnea also occurs in number of disorders across all age groups and both genders. Common causes of central sleep apnea in adults are congestive heart failure and chronic use of opioids to treat pain. Under such circumstances, diagnosis and treatment of central sleep apnea may improve quality of life, morbidity, and perhaps mortality. The mechanisms of central sleep apnea have been best studied in congestive heart failure and hypoxic conditions when there is increased CO2 sensitivity below eupnea resulting in lowering eupneic PCO2 below apneic threshold causing cessation of breathing until the PCO2 rises above the apneic threshold when breathing resumes. In many other disorders, the mechanism of central sleep apnea (CSA) remains to be investigated.", "references": ["55a470512401bde6691d921a", "53e99fd6b7602d97028b5af2", "53e9b74fb7602d97042ee0b6", "53e9b4f5b7602d9704024358", "53e9ae22b7602d97038355ce", "53e9b5c1b7602d9704108801", "56d92c60dabfae2eeee008ae", "53e9b023b7602d9703a7f2f8", "55a36b37612ca648686c1ff3", "55a53fb9c91bf3b1cc52f776", "56d86153dabfae2eee7eb1db", "56d84f97dabfae2eeef86a79", "55a55c0f612c6b12ab142b03", "53e9a186b7602d9702a7acab", "53e9b7e8b7602d97043983e0", "55a444b9612ca648688efeb6", "53e9b05cb7602d9703abfce8", "55a45295612ca6486891afca", "55a46eaf2401bde6691d2820", "53e9b115b7602d9703b9467e", "56d925bfdabfae2eeeb9dde7", "53e9b6a2b7602d9704217491", "53e9bcb3b7602d97049331e9", "53e99fc3b7602d970289f782", "53e99fd0b7602d97028a868e", "55a3c0be612ca64868777e7e", "53e9a6cab7602d9702ffb829", "53e9a0d9b7602d97029c4a1d", "53e9a576b7602d9702e9ddef", "55a34848612ca6486867a758", "55a66f29612ca6eebaaff947", "53e9a635b7602d9702f630c2", "53e9aebcb7602d97038e2785", "53e998dbb7602d9702114109", "53e9aba4b7602d9703551e14", "56d8f628dabfae2eee9494a7", "53e9b4f5b7602d9704024dcb", "56d826fbdabfae2eeee36c41", "53e9b6b9b7602d97042424e9", "55a39902612ca648687267c5", "53e9a7e3b7602d9703120237", "53e9b7cdb7602d97043773d6", "53e9b3abb7602d9703e91805", "56d8dd86dabfae2eeefcb2fb", "53e9b304b7602d9703dc9ac9", "56d910c8dabfae2eee3a1bf1", "53e99f69b7602d970283bb35", "53e9ab97b7602d970353e978", "53e99f20b7602d97027ed9b7", "53e9aed8b7602d9703903cf5", "55a455ef612ca648689274f0", "55a3961f612ca6486871f648", "55a5d8dc2401defa0da64a08", "55a488f3240103289972ce31", "53e9ab3db7602d97034cb82b", "55a4dad724011b361ad01ab5", "55a4a4c9c91bf3b1cc4204a8", "55a45beb612ca64868939936", "53e9b94cb7602d9704535c0c", "53e9a194b7602d9702a88f6b", "53e9a751b7602d97030861f8", "55a387d2612ca648687033ac", "55a5000b24012c2a3909c9d3", "53e9a3c0b7602d9702ccfd0a", "55a664d0612ca6eebaae9f3a", "53e9b739b7602d97042cffb8", "53e9b290b7602d9703d37314", "55a62ccb240199498b98f9ae", "53e9b4f5b7602d970402477c", "53e9aa7ab7602d97033f31fd", "55a5f4752401defa0dabef82", "53e9a310b7602d9702c187a7", "53e9a246b7602d9702b4dc2c", "55a611ab240199498b96f0f3", "55a400c4612ca6486880c239", "56d8d124dabfae2eeea51203", "53e9b33db7602d9703e0f5b6", "56d8d122dabfae2eeea4ffd9", "53e9a645b7602d9702f75fbb", "55a67550612ca6eebab0e397", "53e99b86b7602d970242a841", "53e9b64fb7602d97041abc46", "53e9b83fb7602d97043fef87", "55a3ea54c91b587b0966a240", "55a3e58f612ca648687ca0d9", "55a387632401aa93797be8fa", "53e9a40eb7602d9702d2819b", "53e9b8e8b7602d97044c9207", "53e9bbbcb7602d97048094ed", "55a4fb28612c6b12ab005315", "53e9a335b7602d9702c40dc3", "53e99db1b7602d9702673108", "53e9ba70b7602d97046949ab", "53e9a9fdb7602d9703366fcd", "55a604b3240199498b953976", "56d91630dabfae2eee5b027e", "55a3f5352401c6de3b7bcdde", "53e9b52db7602d97040653ab", "53e99b04b7602d9702397075", "55a66f29612ca6eebaaff948", "53e9b833b7602d97043f2a5b", "53e99827b7602d970204cab3"]}

A polyp is a localized\n lesion that projects above the surrounding mucosa. Adenomatous polyps (adenomas) are benign neoplasms that arise from colorectal\n glandular epithelium. In the United States (US), colorectal adenoma (CRA) prevalence is approximately 25% by age 50 and rises\n to around 50% by age 70. The histological hallmarks of a CRA are altered glandular architecture and dysplasia of the epithelium.\n The great majority of CRCs develop from CRAs in a process called the adenoma-carcinoma sequence. This process may take from\n years to decades for the earliest CRA to progress to CRC (Leslie et al. 2002). A CRA progresses to become a CRC when the dysplastic\n cells invade through the muscularis mucosa. While most CRCs develop from CRAs, fewer than 10% of CRAs ever progress to CRC.\n Hyperplastic colorectal polyps are histologically distinct from CRAs, occur most frequently in the rectum and sigmoid colon,\n are not neoplastic and do not progress to CRC. Besides CRAs, the inflammatory bowel diseases, ulcerative colitis (UC) and\n Crohn\u2019s disease of the colon (Crohn\u2019s colitis), predispose to CRC.\n \n CRCs evolve through distinct genetic pathways involving genetic instability, which is the driving force for tumor development\n (Lengauer et al. 1998). Three genetic instability pathways have been identified in CRC. They are called chromosomal instability\n (Rajagopalan et al. 2003), microsatellite instability (MSI), and the CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP). Chromosomal instability\n is the tumorigenic mechanism in FAP and in approximately 85% of sporadic CRCs that develop as a result of losses of both APC alleles and other tumor suppressor genes (Vogelstein et al. 1988).

Fortunately, the prognosis is excellent if detected at an early stage. Hence, the detection and localization of prostate cancer is crucial for diagnosis, as well as treatment via targeted focal therapy. New imaging techniques can potentially be invaluable tools for improving prostate cancer detection and localization.In this study, we introduce a new form of diffusion magnetic resonance imaging called correlated diffusion imaging, where the tissue being imaged is characterized by the joint correlation of diffusion signal attenuation across multiple gradient pulse strengths and timings. By taking into account signal attenuation at different water diffusion motion sensitivities, correlated diffusion imaging can provide improved delineation between cancerous tissue and healthy tissue when compared to existing diffusion imaging modalities.Quantitative evaluation using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, tissue class separability analysis, and visual assessment by an expert radiologist were performed to study correlated diffusion imaging for the task of prostate cancer diagnosis. These results are compared with that obtained using T2-weighted imaging and standard diffusion imaging (via the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC)). Experimental results suggest that correlated diffusion imaging provide improved delineation between healthy and cancerous tissue and may have potential as a diagnostic tool for cancer detection and localization in the prostate gland.A new form of diffusion magnetic resonance imaging called correlated diffusion imaging (CDI) was developed for the purpose of aiding radiologists in cancer detection and localization in the prostate gland. Preliminary results show CDI shows considerable promise as a diagnostic aid for radiologists in the detection and localization of prostate cancer.", "references": ["53e9bb66b7602d97047a55a1", "53e9ade2b7602d97037e9c0e", "53e9b9fbb7602d97045f942c", "55a5403865ceb7cb02e5e26c", "53e99f77b7602d970284a75c", "53e9be79b7602d9704b3c95a", "53e9b89bb7602d9704471d79", "53e9ab42b7602d97034d4eef", "53e9be03b7602d9704ab5655", "53e9b6e8b7602d970427bb76", "53e9a7c8b7602d970310703a", "55a398c565ce5cd7b3b0482b", "55a46b8d65ce31bc877a120d", "53e9abc4b7602d97035772b1", "55a43c8b612ca648688d4d5a", "53e9a26ab7602d9702b701f9", "53e9a1d0b7602d9702ac8e62", "56d81bcedabfae2eee9946f3", "53e9b4b4b7602d9703fc6d5d", "53e9b017b7602d9703a6f7c9", "53e9a89bb7602d97031e73ed"]}

Crowdsourcing encompasses an emerging collection of approaches for harnessing such distributed human intelligence. Recently, the bioinformatics community has begun to apply crowdsourcing in a variety of contexts, yet few resources are available that describe how these human-powered systems work and how to use them effectively in scientific domains.Here, we provide a framework for understanding and applying several different types of crowdsourcing. The framework considers two broad classes: systems for solving large-volume 'microtasks' and systems for solving high-difficulty 'megatasks'. Within these classes, we discuss system types, including volunteer labor, games with a purpose, microtask markets and open innovation contests. We illustrate each system type with successful examples in bioinformatics and conclude with a guide for matching problems to crowdsourcing solutions that highlights the positives and negatives of different approaches.", "references": ["56d81a78dabfae2eee8fe4e6", "53e9a2b9b7602d9702bbff68", "53e99c04b7602d97024b063a", "56d818bbdabfae2eee8455eb", "53e99967b7602d97021aa842", "53e9b895b7602d970446f061", "53e9b891b7602d970446450a", "56d81e9fdabfae2eeeac2fbe", "56d8f4d9dabfae2eee8c733e", "55a4df5665ceb7cb02da956e", "55a49d0a65ceb7cb02d400f4", "55a5031a65ceb7cb02de7e54", "55a4d19065ceb7cb02d900d9", "55a5042b65ceb7cb02de9dc4", "53e9a26ab7602d9702b6f343", "53e9a4a3b7602d9702dc3ac3", "53e9b962b7602d97045513c6", "53e9b437b7602d9703f33622", "53e9992ab7602d97021646aa", "53e9ad26b7602d970370785f", "53e9b52db7602d9704066657", "53e9a0f3b7602d97029dbb86", "53e99d1bb7602d97025cf922", "55a8be95240153a85d6fb005", "55a4b62565ceb7cb02d6a8ff", "53e9af46b7602d97039832fb", "56d87462dabfae2eee0d2d92", "56d81e9cdabfae2eeeac1dff", "53e9b3efb7602d9703edcedb", "55a49c5265ceb7cb02d3c8a5", "55a41ae365ce5cd7b3c46f4c", "56d92e88dabfae2eeeeb8add", "53e9a02db7602d9702910e66", "53e9a8dbb7602d970322bb8b", "558cd0f915f38090e2f2a25e", "53e9ab82b7602d970352f0b0", "53e9ade9b7602d97037f14ab", "53e9a8ccb7602d9703219082", "53e9a67cb7602d9702facdf6", "53e9b600b7602d9704155e9f", "55a5067865ceb7cb02ded5df", "55a45da865ce31bc8778478d", "53e9b310b7602d9703dd638c", "53e9a14cb7602d9702a3e13d", "53e99976b7602d97021ba859", "56d81ea0dabfae2eeeac362c", "53e999ffb7602d970224b607", "55a5052e65ceb7cb02deaee9"]}

Although widely used, existing GM algorithms cannot incorporate global consistence among nodes, which is a natural constraint in computer vision problems. This paper proposes deformable graph matching (DGM), an extension of GM for matching graphs subject to global rigid and non-rigid geometric constraints. The key idea of this work is a new factorization of the pair-wise affinity matrix. This factorization decouples the affinity matrix into the local structure of each graph and the pair-wise affinity edges. Besides the ability to incorporate global geometric transformations, this factorization offers three more benefits. First, there is no need to compute the costly (in space and time) pair-wise affinity matrix. Second, it provides a unified view of many GM methods and extends the standard iterative closest point algorithm. Third, it allows to use the path-following optimization algorithm that leads to improved optimization strategies and matching performance. Experimental results on synthetic and real databases illustrate how DGM outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms for GM.

We agree that there is no evidence that in the case we described the cryoglobulin was secondary to acute parvovirus infection, but it was most likely a coincidental infection.2 We are confident that this was an acute infection as, unlike the previous cases of anti-parvovirus IgG positivity in patients with cryoglobulinemia,3 we confirmed infection by performing parvovirus quantitative PCR that showed viral DNA in the patient's blood. Indeed this is why we investigated the cryoprecipitate and showed that there was no increased anti-parvovirus activity in the cryoprecipitate compared to the serum. The title of our article sought to highlight the fact that the case was not secondary to hepatitis C or B infection and may have better been entitled \u2018non-viral hepatitis-associated cryoglobulinemia\u2019. In addition to our findings, data from other centers suggest that in Northern European populations mixed essential cryoglobulinemia is often not associated with hepatitis C or B viral infections, in contrast to cases from Southern Europe.4 Unlike parvovirus B19, hepatitis C virus is capable of exerting a direct effect on B lymphocytes, lending a pathophysiological link to the production of cryoglobulins.

A key functionality required for efficient BioPAX data exchange is validation-detecting errors and inconsistencies in BioPAX documents. The BioPAX Validator is a command-line tool, Java library and online web service for BioPAX that performs >100 classes of consistency checks.The validator recognizes common syntactic errors and semantic inconsistencies and reports them in a customizable human readable format. It can also automatically fix some errors and normalize BioPAX data. Since its release, the validator has become a critical tool for the pathway informatics community, detecting thousands of errors and helping substantially increase the conformity and uniformity of BioPAX-formatted data. The BioPAX Validator is open source and released under LGPL v3 license. All sources, binaries and documentation can be found at sf.net/p/biopax, and the latest stable version of the web application is available at biopax.org/validator.", "references": ["5550406345ce0a409eb33f6d", "53e9ba32b7602d970464140d", "56d81e98dabfae2eeeac06a6", "53e9a1d0b7602d9702acaa52", "53e9aeb1b7602d97038d5251", "53e9ae8ab7602d97038ab591"]}
