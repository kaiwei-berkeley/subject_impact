Even though this entity is real and an important problem, it is rarely reported in literature. We report six cases of partner dyspareunia, in which there were two incidences of partner penile injury, occurring as a complication of synthetic midurethral sling surgery. There were three tension-free vaginal tapes, two transobturator tapes and one anterior intravaginal sling in the series. Time interval between tape insertion and the presentation of complications ranged from 3 to 48 months. Vaginal exposure was seen in five of the six cases and in one patient prominence of sling material without exposure was noted. Recognizing partner dyspareunia as an important complication of the vaginal use of alloplastic prosthesis is not only important in preoperative counseling of patients but also to avoid legal implications.", "references": ["53e9b43db7602d9703f393b2", "53e9bbf0b7602d970484688f", "53e9b089b7602d9703af1a01", "53e99dbfb7602d970268149e", "53e99a20b7602d9702275f55"]}

Babies with CH who are not identified and treated promptly develop severe mental retardation. Most of the babies with CH do not manifest the typical known signs and symptoms of hypothyroidism, and this is most likely due to transplacental passage of some maternal thyroid hormone in addition to some residual neonatal thyroid function, as might be seen with thyroid hypoplasia, an ectopic gland, or mild dyshormonogenesis. Screening for CH has enabled the virtual eradication of the devastating effects of mental retardation due to sporadic CH in most developed countries of the world. CH is classified into permanent and transient forms, which in turn can be divided into primary, secondary, or peripheral etiologies. Permanent CH refers to a persistent deficiency of thyroid hormone that requires life-long treatment. Transient CH refers to a temporary deficiency of thyroid hormone that is discovered at birth but recovers to normal in the first few months or years of life. In the last several decades, there have been exciting advances in our understanding of fetal and neonatal thyroid physiology. In addition, advances in molecular biology have helped in understanding the early events in thyroid gland embryogenesis, mechanisms of thyroid action in the brain, the molecular basis for many of the inborn errors of thyroid hormonogenesis, and thyroid hormone action. However, many questions and challenges are still not answered. For example, the increasing numbers of surviving small and premature neonates with abnormalities in thyroid function need definite diagnostic criteria and whether they require medical therapy. Another challenge is the dilemma of finding the best screening methodology that is sensitive and cost effective.", "references": ["53e99e71b7602d9702735cb9", "53e9a775b7602d97030b04b8", "53e9b260b7602d9703d03099", "53e9a952b7602d97032a59e0", "53e9a88cb7602d97031d90a8", "53e9a49db7602d9702dbd547", "53e9aad1b7602d970344d8ec", "53e9ba28b7602d9704631386", "53e99aa6b7602d97023214be", "53e9b9b4b7602d97045a4ddc"]}

Though these algorithms are shown to work properly by various computer simulations, they are still lack of rigorous theoretical proofs for both the convergence of the algorithms and the rates of convergence for these algorithms. On the other hand, all the nodes are not likely to be identical in many practical applications. In particular, there might be a node that needs to interact with the \u201coutside\u201d world and thus may not have the freedom to adjust its local clock. Motivated by all these, in this paper we consider the desynchronization problem in a system where there exists an anchored node that never adjusts the phase of its oscillator. For such a system, we propose a generic anchored desynchronization algorithm that achieves \u2208-desynchrony (defined in [4]) in O(n2ln(n/\u2208)) rounds of firings. We also prove that our algorithm converges even for the generalized processor sharing (GPS) scheme, where every node is assigned a weight and the amount of resource received by a node is proportional to its weight. In comparison with the original algorithm in [4], we show that the rate of convergence of the original algorithm in [4] is not always better than ours and it is only better in the asymptotic regime.", "references": ["53e9b614b7602d970416bf3d"]}

Grid computing is the study\n of resource sharing among entities, known as virtual organizations, which solve complex business, societal, scientific, and\n engineering problems. Within the Grid computing community, service is sometimes defined as protocols plus behavior. Both Grid\n computing and service science are connecting academic, industry, government, and volunteer sector collaborators on a range\n of projects including eScience, healthcare, environmental sustainability, and more.

This study aimed to describe the frequency of migrainous features concurrent with episodes of syncope and to propose clinical criteria for assessing whether a migrainous mechanism might underlie syncope.This retrospective, questionnaire-based study developed criteria for syncopal migraine based on the International Classification of Headache Disorders II (ICHD-II) migraine criteria. Two hundred and forty-eight recurrent syncope subjects (>3 episodes) were stratified based on the presence (N = 127) or absence (N = 121) of a headache concurrent with syncopal episodes. Syncopal headaches were classified as either syncopal migraine (meeting ICHD-II criteria for migraine or probable migraine, without aura) or nonspecific (not meeting the criteria for syncopal migraine). The syncope groups were then compared to 199 subjects with migraine headaches using chi-square and Cochran-Armitage test for trend.Nearly one-third of recurrent syncope subjects met criteria for syncopal migraine. This group resembled the migraine headache population more than the syncope population in age, gender, autonomic testing, and comorbid conditions. The syncopal migraine group also reported a longer duration of syncope and a longer recovery time to normal. Finally, anti-migrainous medications reduced syncope in half of the syncopal migraine subjects.Syncope may have a migrainous basis more commonly than previously suspected, and we suggested criteria to identify these patients. Syncopal migraine appears epidemiologically more closely related to migraine than to reflex syncope.", "references": ["53e9a089b7602d970296ea17", "53e9ae5cb7602d9703879905", "53e9ba4fb7602d9704669199", "53e9a35fb7602d9702c6891e", "53e997f5b7602d9701ffc0ff", "53e999bbb7602d9702203e6e", "53e9ab1ab7602d970349dff0", "53e99acab7602d9702348835", "53e99e38b7602d97026f96b0", "53e99b30b7602d97023cc3b6"]}

However, most manifold learning methods assume that there is a dominant low-dimensional manifold, while other variations are usually considered as noise or even ignored. This paper proposes a novel submanifold decomposition (SMD) algorithm, which simultaneously considers multiple submanifolds intertwined in the same high-dimensional space for decomposition. It makes full use of multi-category labels of a dataset to improve the modeling of manifolds of each label. In order to applied the proposed method to practical applications, the linear version of SMD is developed subsequently. Comparative experiments demonstrate that the proposed method not only effectively extracts submanifolds by subspace learning, but also outperforms traditional manifold and subspace learning methods for visual recognition tasks.", "references": ["53e9bcc0b7602d970493f289"]}

Queueing networks (QNs) have been proved\n to be a powerful and versatile tool for system performance evaluation and prediction. First we briefly survey QNs that consist\n of a single service center, i.e., the basic queueing systems defined under various hypotheses, and we discuss their analysis\n to evaluate a set of performance indices, such as resource utilization and throughput and customer response time. Their solution\n is based on the introduction of an underlying stochastic Markov process. Then, we introduce QNs that consist of a set of service\n centers representing the system resources that provide service to a collection of customers that represent the users. Various\n types of customers define the customers classes in the network that are gathered in chains. We consider various analytical\n methods to analyze QNs with single-class and multiple-class. We mostly focus on product-form QNs that have a simple closed\n form expression of the stationary state distribution that allows to define efficient algorithms to evaluate average performance\n measures. We review the basic results, stating from the BCMP theorem that defines a large class of product-form QNs, and we\n present the main solution algorithms for single-class e multiple-class QNs. We discuss some interesting properties of QNs\n including the arrival theorem, exact aggregation and insensitivity. Finally, we discuss some particular models of product-form\n QNs that allow to represent special system features such as state-dependent routing, negative customers, customers batch arrivals\n and departures and finite capacity queues. The class of QN models is illustrated through some application examples of to analyze\n computer and communication systems.\n ", "references": ["53e9ae36b7602d970384dbbb", "53e9b93eb7602d9704528b76", "53e99b31b7602d97023cf51c", "53e9bd6ab7602d9704a08390", "53e9a4f3b7602d9702e12aa5", "53e9ab07b7602d970348e06e", "53e99893b7602d97020cd475", "53e9ab07b7602d970348cf91", "53e9accbb7602d97036a8b9d", "53e9a906b7602d970325869b", "53e9afe1b7602d9703a331d3", "53e9ae8ab7602d97038ad38f", "53e9a298b7602d9702b9ddf9", "53e9bd98b7602d9704a41b64", "53e99f4fb7602d970281d539", "53e9a841b7602d9703188411", "53e9bb94b7602d97047dc5a8", "53e99aecb7602d9702376767", "53e9ae11b7602d970381ba79", "53e9b78ab7602d9704331b3b", "53e9b281b7602d9703d24672", "53e9b94db7602d970453cdcd", "53e9a958b7602d97032b29b6", "53e9acdab7602d97036b95b3", "53e9a09fb7602d9702987311", "53e9ad98b7602d970379358c", "53e9bc15b7602d970487a9c0", "53e9bbf5b7602d97048539be", "53e99b95b7602d970243eddb", "53e99f7fb7602d9702853e92", "53e9a2bab7602d9702bc4bd5", "53e99aa6b7602d9702321143", "53e9ae90b7602d97038b43f5", "53e99885b7602d97020be166", "53e99a9fb7602d970231a090", "53e9b9c1b7602d97045b8d45", "53e9a711b7602d9703048e0b", "53e99aa6b7602d9702321142", "53e9a091b7602d970297a35a", "53e99ae7b7602d9702372916", "53e9b91eb7602d970450667c", "53e99b04b7602d97023946a4", "53e999f5b7602d970223bde5", "53e9b850b7602d970441503e", "53e9a3f5b7602d9702d0e8b6", "53e9b40eb7602d9703f04d0a", "53e9a533b7602d9702e552b1", "53e99e6ab7602d9702730369", "53e9a232b7602d9702b38797", "53e9ac5bb7602d970362c95b", "53e9a3dbb7602d9702cf0092", "53e99d44b7602d97025f8bef", "53e9b010b7602d9703a68876", "53e9b601b7602d9704157ad4", "53e9a6dfb7602d9703011213", "53e9bb7ab7602d97047be06f", "53e9afeeb7602d9703a42682", "53e9b51bb7602d970405116e", "53e9b52db7602d9704064cc9", "53e9afd3b7602d9703a261a4", "53e9bbcfb7602d9704819b0b", "53e9a62fb7602d9702f60415", "53e9a8aab7602d97031f7bc5", "53e9a343b7602d9702c505fd", "55323bdc45cec66b6f9dabfc", "53e9ae84b7602d97038a4531", "53e9a12ab7602d9702a18bfd", "53e9ae22b7602d9703837d80", "53e9ad05b7602d97036e6994", "53e99aedb7602d9702378858", "53e9ad68b7602d970374f53b", "53e9addab7602d97037e18a0"]}

The concept is as applicable to the backyard gardener as it is to the commercial grower. Selection is the key to successful establishment and plant longevity. Aside from aesthetic considerations such as differences in flower color or leaf texture, a plant should have proven hardiness and suit- ability for the climate and site in which it is to be placed. The minimum temperature and the amount of annual precipita- tion in a region are often the most important factors regulating plant hardiness; soil factors strongly influence a plant's suitability for the prospective growing site. An ornamental variety that occa- sionally suffers winter injury from low temperatures or drying winds may temporarily lose its aesthetic value if subjected to such condi- tions. If repeated winter injury occurs, the plant may lose its func- tional value as well. Annual rainfall can be supplemented by timely irrigation, but little can be done about the effects of excessive precipitation, except for the possible improvement of soil drainage. The soil can be al- tered to improve its texture or depth on a small scale, but extensive alterations are costly. Growing conditions within a site may vary from more severe to more favorable than the established norm for the area. The subtle differences in soil drainage, pH, air drainage, light, wind velocity and direction, and the site's proximity to salt water, pavement, or utility lines will influence the plant's health, as well as the life cycles of organisms associated with the plant. A slight modification of the micro-environment to improve the site suitability for a particular plant or crop is often practiced in plant protection. Sometimes, as in the case of the common scab of potatoes, a cultural change (such as the lowering of the soil pH below 5.2) has its principal effect on the pathogen ( Streptomyces scabies ) which thrives in soil with a pH of 5.2 or above. However, should a site require continual modification or the plant need continual protection from an adverse environmental factor, it would be wiser and easier to select a plant suited to the site's limita- tions.", "references": ["53e9a46bb7602d9702d8a830"]}

High levels of internalized homophobia exist among South African MSM: 10-15% reported \"often/very often\" and over 20% reported \"sometimes\" having feelings of internalized homophobia. A greater level of internalized homophobia was significantly associated with a lower level of education [Adjusted Odds Ratio = 2.2; 95% CI = 1.1-4.9], a higher level of HIV misinformation [AOR = 2.7; 95% CI: 1.3-5.3], bisexual identity (vs. homosexual) [AOR = 5.5; 95% CI: 2.5-12.0], and HIV-related conspiracy beliefs [AOR = 2.4; 95% CI: 1.02-5.8].

In an attempt to estimate whether nanotechnology can threaten more sensitive parts of the population such as children, we provide a brief overview of the potential pathways of introducing ENPs into the environment and the state-of-the-art techniques for assessing human exposure, as well as our current knowledge on their toxic effects.", "references": ["53e9aa79b7602d97033edfed", "53e9b45eb7602d9703f5a905", "53e9bc27b7602d9704892ab8", "53e9a8b7b7602d970320378b", "53e9ad81b7602d9703775644", "53e9ad18b7602d97036fafba", "53e99b1bb7602d97023ae216", "56d91577dabfae2eee5707b3", "56d8d9d8dabfae2eeee541a0", "53e9b29cb7602d9703d43065", "53e9badfb7602d970470d6d2", "53e9bc48b7602d97048bfd17", "53e9ba2db7602d97046381f9", "53e9a5beb7602d9702ee7f5f", "53e9a374b7602d9702c7f105", "56d818a5dabfae2eee83b584", "53e9af53b7602d9703994ffd", "55a4b187612ca64868a046e3", "53e9ba4ab7602d970465d30e", "53e9b4d4b7602d9703ff52ac", "56d926d0dabfae2eeec026c9", "53e9bd1eb7602d97049a7dff", "53e9b56cb7602d97040a6e84", "56d8f491dabfae2eee8ac1ca", "53e9a965b7602d97032bf176", "56d91e8fdabfae2eee8f2625", "53e9a952b7602d97032a960a", "53e9bb0fb7602d970474be6e", "53e9a0adb7602d9702994b12", "53e9b9d3b7602d97045ca28a", "56d83b62dabfae2eee616c07"]}

The aim of this study was to determine if ankle proprioception is targeted in exercises on unstable surfaces. Lateral ankle sprain (LAS) has recurrence rates over 70%, which are believed to be due to a reduced accuracy of proprioceptive signals from the ankle. Proprioceptive exercises in rehabilitation of LAS mostly consist of balancing activities on an unstable surface. The methods include 100 healthy adults stood barefoot on a solid surface and a foam pad over a force plate, with occluded vision. Mechanical vibration was used to stimulate proprioceptive output of muscle spindles of triceps surae and lumbar paraspinal musculature. Each trial lasted for 60 s; vibration was applied from the 15th till the 30th second. Changes in mean velocity and mean position of the center of pressure (CoP) as a result of muscle vibration were calculated. Results show that on foam, the effect of triceps surae vibration on mean CoP velocity was significantly smaller than on a solid surface, while for paraspinal musculature vibration the effect was bigger on foam than on solid surface. Similar effects were seen for mean CoP displacement as outcome. Exercises on unstable surfaces appear not to target peripheral ankle proprioception. Exercises on an unstable surface may challenge the capacity of the central nervous system to shift the weighting of sources of proprioceptive signals on balance.", "references": ["53e99ddbb7602d970269ee3e", "53e9b295b7602d9703d3a846", "53e9a55cb7602d9702e8154d", "53e9b259b7602d9703cf84e9", "53e9b4d9b7602d9703ffa9ed", "53e99fbcb7602d97028966a4", "53e9b69eb7602d97042159d2", "53e9b0abb7602d9703b1ae23", "53e9b78ab7602d9704330753", "53e9af40b7602d970397e612", "55a3b18a612ca6486875df0a", "56d9190edabfae2eee6d4f25", "55a68071612ca6eebab24fd5", "53e9a472b7602d9702d911a9", "53e99f57b7602d97028277a0", "53e998dbb7602d9702119d7a", "53e9b891b7602d970446440a", "53e9b4e4b7602d9704009f3b", "53e9ae22b7602d9703831c95", "53e9a2acb7602d9702bb0e81", "55a3522124012c2ab7a677fd", "53e9bc3bb7602d97048b2177", "53e99f41b7602d970280f206", "53e9bc09b7602d970486b0d9", "55a52c54612c6b12ab05d7ac", "55a674d9612ca6eebab0d697", "53e9a8d4b7602d970322319c", "55a55ff724012c2a391f9f35", "53e9b9edb7602d97045e7e04", "55a437c2612ca648688c8a4c", "55a3522124012c2ab7a677fc", "53e9b055b7602d9703aba017", "55a56c0b612c6b12ab196abd", "55a37cba612ca648686e76d4", "53e9b16db7602d9703bf100c"]}

The specific biochemical characteristics explaining such disparities and their relative importance are largely unknown. Using a modeling approach, we show that modifying the kinetic parameters of pyruvate dehydrogenase and mitochondrial NADH shuttling within a realistic interval can yield a striking switch in lactate flux direction. In this context, cells having essentially an oxidative profile exhibit pronounced extracellular lactate uptake and consumption. However, they can be turned into cells with prominent aerobic glycolysis by selectively reducing the aforementioned parameters. In the case of primarily oxidative cells, we also examined the role of glycolysis and lactate transport in providing pyruvate to mitochondria in order to sustain oxidative phosphorylation. The results show that changes in lactate transport capacity and extracellular lactate concentration within the range described experimentally can sustain enhanced oxidative metabolism upon activation. Such a demonstration provides key elements to understand why certain brain cell types constitutively adopt a particular metabolic profile and how specific features can be altered under different physiological and pathological conditions in order to face evolving energy demands.", "references": ["53e9b381b7602d9703e5f885", "55a40e2865ce5cd7b3c25cc3", "53e9ad4fb7602d97037369cb", "55a3d03665ce5cd7b3b8a9cf", "56d8f488dabfae2eee8a8943", "53e99f48b7602d9702815e63", "53e9ab00b7602d9703485cc1", "558be8ff15f32cf6a3d00736", "53e9b0d8b7602d9703b55ddf", "56d828e9dabfae2eeeef4624", "53e9ae76b7602d9703894593", "53e9b762b7602d97043081d5", "53e9b483b7602d9703f88503", "55a4739265ce31bc877b3e78", "53e9ba9bb7602d97046c7cfc", "55a3c78265ce5cd7b3b77085", "56d922efdabfae2eeea8ce84", "53e9b268b7602d9703d0c037", "56d922eedabfae2eeea8c962", "56d922f2dabfae2eeea8dda9", "55a41eae65ce5cd7b3c4fbc0", "55a516bc24012c2a390f2081", "55a3fca965ce5cd7b3bf66d2", "56d9153edabfae2eee558cae", "53e9b44bb7602d9703f48794", "53e9ae97b7602d97038b8fdf", "55a46bcb65ce31bc877a150f", "53e99ff0b7602d97028d28af", "53e9a45cb7602d9702d7851d", "53e99d28b7602d97025dac76", "53e9af33b7602d970396e0a5", "53e99b04b7602d9702391109", "53e9b108b7602d9703b85a5f", "55a49be365ceb7cb02d3ab81", "53e9aae6b7602d9703469ea4", "53e9ba2db7602d970463b52f", "55a478ea65ce31bc877c12ac", "53e9aa56b7602d97033c2e2e", "53e9a4f2b7602d9702e10672", "55a3d68a65ce5cd7b3b96a10", "56d84ef8dabfae2eeef41f6b", "53e99fc9b7602d97028a149d", "55a3ea5dc91b587b0966ab8b", "55a41123c91b587b096bb4e7", "55a4629065ce31bc8778e6c8", "53e9a38fb7602d9702c9b80e", "53e9b9b4b7602d97045a4833", "53e9b070b7602d9703ad858d", "56d922f0dabfae2eeea8d111", "53e9ab82b7602d970352ed82", "53e9985fb7602d97020983e3", "53e9a767b7602d97030a31b8", "53e9bd2ab7602d97049b5013", "55a52dc2c91bf3b1cc50ca3b", "558a6900e4b031bae1f777fa", "55a4934065ceb7cb02d256f0", "53e9b7f5b7602d97043a572b", "53e9a388b7602d9702c98934", "53e9b07cb7602d9703ae18df", "53e9aa61b7602d97033d2d89"]}

We therefore wished to determine whether plasma from patients with AS contained autoantibodies and, if so, characterize and quantify this response in comparison to patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and healthy controls. Two high density nucleic acid programmable protein arrays expressing a total of 3498 proteins were screened with plasma from 25 patients with AS, 17 with RA, and 25 healthy controls. Autoantigens identified were subjected to Ingenuity Pathway Analysis to determine the patterns of signaling cascades or tissue origin. 44% of patients with ankylosing spondylitis demonstrated a broad autoantibody response, as compared with 33% of patients with RA and only 8% of healthy controls. Individuals with AS demonstrated autoantibody responses to shared autoantigens, and 60% of autoantigens identified in the AS cohort were restricted to that group. The autoantibody responses in the AS patients were targeted toward connective, skeletal, and muscular tissue, unlike those of RA patients or healthy controls.

The expressions of STEAP4, TNF\u03b1, and IL-6 were compared in synovia of RA and osteoarthritis patients. STEAP4 induction was examined in TNF\u03b1-stimulated fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) in vitro. FLS (with/without TNF\u03b1 stimulation) were also analyzed for IL-6 expression after STEAP4 knockdown, using siRNA or transfection with STEAP4-plasmid DNA. IL-8, cell proliferation, and apoptosis were also evaluated in STEAP4-overexpressing FLS. The expression of STEAP4 in joints correlated with TNF\u03b1 expression, specifically in RA synovium. In the cultured FLS, STEAP4 protein expression was augmented by TNF\u03b1 activation, and localized in endosomal/lysosomal compartments. STEAP4 downregulation by siRNA enhanced the expression of IL-6 mRNA, while STEAP4 overexpression suppressed IL-6 and IL-8 expression, inhibited cell proliferation, and induced apoptosis via caspase-3. The results indicated that human STEAP4 is regulated by TNF\u03b1 in synovium, where it controls IL-6 secretion and proliferation of FLS, suggesting that STEAP4 might potentially suppress the pathogenesis of TNF\u03b1-induced arthritis such as RA.", "references": ["53e9a6edb7602d97030221f4", "53e9b35ab7602d9703e386b9", "53e9bddbb7602d9704a8f476", "56d823fedabfae2eeecfa451", "53e9b5edb7602d970413f7f0", "53e9bc1bb7602d9704884596", "53e99d36b7602d97025eceff", "53e9bc48b7602d97048c06c9", "53e99eafb7602d970277a711", "53e998d4b7602d970210c1bd", "53e9ac33b7602d97035fa76b", "53e99cf5b7602d97025ab215", "53e9aad1b7602d970344eec9", "53e9b3abb7602d9703e8b94f", "53e9a186b7602d9702a781ca"]}

The BioNLP shared task competitions have contributed to this recent interest considerably. The first competition (BioNLP'09) focused on extracting biological events from Medline abstracts from a narrow domain, while the theme of the latest competition (BioNLP-ST'11) was generalization and a wider range of text types, event types, and subject domains were considered. We view event extraction as a building block in larger discourse interpretation and propose a two-phase, linguistically-grounded, rule-based methodology. In the first phase, a general, underspecified semantic interpretation is composed from syntactic dependency relations in a bottom-up manner. The notion of embedding underpins this phase and it is informed by a trigger dictionary and argument identification rules. Coreference resolution is also performed at this step, allowing extraction of inter-sentential relations. The second phase is concerned with constraining the resulting semantic interpretation by shared task specifications. We evaluated our general methodology on core biological event extraction and speculation/negation tasks in three main tracks of BioNLP-ST'11 (GENIA, EPI, and ID).We achieved competitive results in GENIA and ID tracks, while our results in the EPI track leave room for improvement. One notable feature of our system is that its performance across abstracts and articles bodies is stable. Coreference resolution results in minor improvement in system performance.

Since core algorithm of BSM is based on binary and integer computations, it has a higher computational efficiency than previous methods. Experimental results on Middlebury benchmark show that BSM has comparable performance with state-of-the-art local stereo methods in terms of both quality and speed.

Incidence of TIN is increasing, probably due to prescription habits and NSAID overuse, representing 3-7% of acute kidney injury in biopsies in children. Avoidance of the causal substance and rapid steroid therapy are hallmarks for patient care, but spontaneous initial recovery is very frequent and the general prognosis seems satisfactory.

The solid dispersions were prepared by spray-drying drug-polymer solutions in binary solvent blends containing different proportions of each solvent. The phase behavior was investigated with mDSC, pXRD, FT-IR and TGA. Further, physical stability of solid dispersions was assessed by analyzing after storage at 75% RH.The solid dispersions prepared from solvent/anti-solvent mixture showed better miscibility and physical stability over those prepared from the mixtures of good solvents. Thus, solid dispersions prepared from dichloromethane-acetone exhibited the best physicochemical attributes followed by those prepared from methanol-acetone. FT-IR analysis revealed differential drug-polymer interaction in solid dispersions prepared from various solvent blends, upon the exposure to elevated humidity.Spray-drying from a cocktail of good solvent and anti-solvent with narrower volatility difference produces solid dispersions with better miscibility and physical stability resulting from the simultaneous effect on the polymer conformation and better dispersivity of drug.", "references": ["53e9b365b7602d9703e452a2", "53e9a374b7602d9702c843bc", "53e99d8eb7602d970264adc2", "53e9a515b7602d9702e3a117", "53e99c0bb7602d97024bbc72", "53e998b8b7602d97020f20fd", "53e9b666b7602d97041cb4e9", "56d9170ddabfae2eee60801b", "53e9bcc5b7602d970494b429", "53e9ba39b7602d9704649d6e", "53e9a238b7602d9702b41ba1", "56d8d728dabfae2eeed4634c", "53e9a84eb7602d9703197be3", "55a3a690c91b587b095e0b9c", "53e9b634b7602d9704190f99", "53e9a416b7602d9702d3445c", "53e9a00ab7602d97028ef7a9", "53e9b4abb7602d9703fb98df", "53e9b69eb7602d9704216700", "53e9bbdbb7602d970482f3b7", "53e9a0a6b7602d970298f3ae", "56d8d715dabfae2eeed3de96", "53e9be28b7602d9704ae3745", "53e9aac3b7602d970344481b", "53e99eeeb7602d97027bc335", "53e9b6eeb7602d97042831bf", "53e9a464b7602d9702d7f237", "53e99df7b7602d97026b855b", "53e9a5cdb7602d9702ef7222", "53e9a894b7602d97031e4400", "53e99ca0b7602d9702550b21", "53e9b2b8b7602d9703d660c2", "53e9b321b7602d9703df01fb", "53e9b4bab7602d9703fd255a", "53e99c2fb7602d97024dbfe9", "55a4c4cfc91bf3b1cc463238", "53e99e38b7602d97026fb005", "53e9a57cb7602d9702ea6583", "53e9a358b7602d9702c65da7", "53e9b1ffb7602d9703c927ce", "53e9bbfbb7602d9704857610"]}

Nevertheless, we are able to provide bounds for the [Formula: see text]- and [Formula: see text]-vectors of those complexes which yield new bounds on chromatic polynomials of hypergraphs. Moreover, though it is proven that the coloring complex of a hypergraph has a wedge decomposition, we provide an example showing that in general this decomposition is not homotopy equivalent to a wedge of spheres. In addition, we can completely characterize those hypergraphs whose coloring complex is connected.", "references": ["56d8ab57dabfae2eeeb5887f", "53e9aecbb7602d97038f564b", "53e9b010b7602d9703a66010", "53e9b75ab7602d97042fbc79", "53e9a9f6b7602d970335c664", "53e997f5b7602d9701ff8554", "53e999ffb7602d970224b8b3", "53e9b33db7602d9703e11d57", "53e9b048b7602d9703aa709e", "56d91cc0dabfae2eee84a45f", "53e9afb4b7602d9703a04636", "53e9a699b7602d9702fcd620", "53e9b688b7602d97041f2f8b", "53e9aafab7602d970347b439", "53e9bc68b7602d97048e33b0", "53e9a7c8b7602d9703107d4e"]}

Prior to the late 1980s, locating bottlenecks between sensory input and response dominated these studies, a different view was that attentional limits involved the importance of maintaining behavioral coherence rather than resulting from a bottleneck. In both cases ideas of resource limits taken over from economics were important. Early evidence relating to the anatomy of attention came from neurological investigations of lesioned patients, but the major impetus for the anatomical approach came from neuroimaging studies that provided evidence of brain networks related to orienting to sensory events and control of response tendencies. The presence of a functional anatomy has supported studies of the development of attention networks and the role of neuromodulators and genetic polymorphisms in their construction. Together these developments have enhanced our understanding of attention and paved the way for significant applications to education, pathology and prevention of mental illness.", "references": ["53e9ab69b7602d9703504e30", "53e9b4e0b7602d97040047a6", "55a4165665ce5cd7b3c3c41c", "53e9a6ecb7602d9703020b88", "53e9b58eb7602d97040d3833", "53e9b90bb7602d97044f2040", "53e9aa41b7602d97033b0707", "56d85c4edabfae2eee58fb0a", "53e9bbc8b7602d9704819672", "53e9b3c1b7602d9703ea8c83", "56d9250adabfae2eeeb5ef43", "53e9ba84b7602d97046a5f27", "53e9b2f5b7602d9703db5f0e", "53e9a5e1b7602d9702f0a1d6", "56d87abddabfae2eee3966dd", "53e9a07ab7602d9702963a63", "53e9a26ab7602d9702b719cd", "53e9b049b7602d9703aaa11c", "53e99baab7602d97024515cf", "56d82b98dabfae2eee004d2e", "53e9a099b7602d9702982736", "53e9a9fdb7602d9703368c35", "53e9b1f1b7602d9703c83e5f", "53e99d8fb7602d970264ec27", "53e9a0bbb7602d97029a56f2", "55a3eedc65ce5cd7b3bd9703", "53e999a5b7602d97021e9d6e", "53e9b527b7602d970405f7b8", "53e9b527b7602d970405e0ce", "53e9b6dcb7602d970426ebdd", "53e9b56cb7602d97040a2cbb", "53e9a8f9b7602d970324bb2a", "53e99f12b7602d97027df7e0", "53e9ac62b7602d9703634200", "56d87667dabfae2eee1b79c2", "53e9b577b7602d97040b3807", "53e9a224b7602d9702b2789a", "53e9b95bb7602d9704549179", "53e9ba6ab7602d970468d8d7", "53e9b3f6b7602d9703ee4648", "53e9a317b7602d9702c20c1f", "53e9b1bcb7602d9703c4a457", "53e9aa61b7602d97033d0901", "53e9b7bbb7602d9704367eb2", "56d871fadabfae2eeefbd47e", "53e99daab7602d970266711f", "53e9b267b7602d9703d0b2e6"]}

We devise channel identification algorithms that recover a projection of the filter(s) onto a space of input signals loss-free for both scalar and vector-valued test signals. The test signals are modeled as elements of a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) with a Dirichlet kernel. Under appropriate limiting conditions on the bandwidth and the order of the test signal space, the filter projection converges to the impulse response of the filter.

Convergence analysis is also discussed about the algorithm based on random search theory. In the meanwhile, to strengthen the search ability in high dimensional space, communication strategy is introduced into the basic algorithm and intermittent exchange is presented to prevent premature convergence. Finally, experiments are carried out for the algorithms.

These PET observations played a pivotal role in guiding the development of fMRI, by demonstrating which physiological parameters were most closely coupled to neuronal activity and by presaging the BOLD-contrast effect. Subsequent PET studies were crucial for constraining theories concerning the physiological mechanisms underlying hemodynamic/neuronal coupling and, thereby, guiding the development of models for quantification of oxygen metabolic rate %\u2206 from fMRI.

We term this problem pliable index coding or PICOD $(t)$ . We prove that, with this formulation, although some instances of the problem become simple, in general, the problem of finding the optimal linear code remains NP-hard. However, we show that it is possible to construct pliable index codes that are substantially smaller than index codes in many cases. If there are $n$ clients, the server has $m$ messages, and each client has a side information set of cardinality $sleq m-t$ ; we show that $O(min {tlog n, t+log ^{2} n})$ broadcast transmissions are sufficient to satisfy all the clients. For $t=1$ , this is an exponential improvement over the $n$ messages required in index coding in the worst case (for $m=n$ ). In addition, for $tgg log ^{2} n$ , the number of broadcast transmissions required is only linearly dependent on $t$ . We generalize the results to instances where the side information sets are not necessarily of equal cardinality. When $m = O(n^delta )$ , for some constant $delta >0$ , we show that the codes of size $O(min {tlog ^{2} n,tlog n+log ^{3} n})$ are sufficient in general. We also consider the scenario when the server only knows the cardinality of the side information sets of the clients and each client is interested in receiving any $t$ messages that it does not have. We term this formulation oblivious pliable index coding or OB-PICOD $(t)$ . If the cardinalities of side information sets of all the clients is $s$ (with $sleq m-t$ ), then we show that $min {s+t,m-s}$ messages are both sufficient and necessary for linear codes. Finally, we develop efficient heuristic approximation algorithms for PICOD $(t)$ and show through simulations on the random instances of PICOD $(t)$ that they perform well in practice.", "references": ["53e9a833b7602d970317b9e1"]}

Quadratic Component Analysis (QCA) extracts responses that are stimulus-induced (triggered by the stimulus but not precisely locked in time), as opposed to stimulus-evoked (time-locked to the stimulus). Induced responses are often found in neural response data from magnetoencephalography (MEG), electroencephalography (EEG), or multichannel electrophysiological and optical recordings. The instantaneous power of a linear combination of channels can be expressed as a weighted sum of instantaneous cross-products between channel waveforms. Based on this fact, a technique known as Denoising Source Separation (DSS) is used to find the most reproducible \"quadratic component\" (linear combination of cross-products). The linear component with a square most similar to this quadratic component is taken to approximate the most reproducible evoked activity. Projecting out the component and repeating the analysis allows multiple induced components to be extracted by deflation. The method is illustrated with synthetic data, as well as real MEG data. At unfavorable signal-to-noise ratios, it can reveal stimulus-induced activity that is invisible to other approaches such as time-frequency analysis.", "references": ["53e9a594b7602d9702ebe233", "53e9a7f8b7602d970313badc", "53e99822b7602d9702041667", "53e99813b7602d970202a30e", "53e9b002b7602d9703a57762", "53e9b2b1b7602d9703d58ca6", "53e9bb52b7602d970478f4e9", "53e9b5f3b7602d9704146a05", "53e9aca8b7602d9703686c4e", "53e9bb1cb7602d9704759576", "53e9a488b7602d9702da936b", "53e99a79b7602d97022ecdbf", "53e9aefcb7602d970392f47b", "56d8b63adabfae2eee0a6091", "53e9abdfb7602d9703596e0b", "53e9b59bb7602d97040e1b95"]}
